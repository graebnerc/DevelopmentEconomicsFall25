## PART 1: INTRODUCTION (10 minutes)

### SLIDE 3: The Development-Environment Nexus
**A Bidirectional Relationship**

Two-way causality:

- Environmental degradation → Development outcomes
- Development activities → Environmental impacts

**Key insight**: The relationship differs by development level and context

---

### SLIDE 4: Environmental Degradation Affects Development

**Disproportionate impacts on developing countries:**

- Climate change impacts (floods, droughts, sea-level rise)
- Resource depletion (water scarcity, soil degradation, fisheries collapse)
- Health costs (air pollution, water contamination)
- Economic disruption (agricultural losses, disaster costs)

**"Environmentalism of the Poor"** (Anguelovski & Martínez-Alier):

- Poor communities often most dependent on environmental resources
- Least able to adapt to environmental shocks
- Different stakes in environmental protection than wealthy countries

---

### SLIDE 5: Development Activities Affect Environment
**Multiple channels:**

- **Scale effect**: More production → More resource use and pollution
- **Composition effect**: Shift to industry → Different environmental footprint
- **Technique effect**: New technologies → Potentially lower impact per unit

**The Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis:**

- Initial development increases pollution
- Beyond certain income level, pollution decreases
- But: Does this hold for all pollutants? For global environmental limits?

---

### SLIDE 6: Planetary Boundaries Framework
**9 Earth System Processes** (Richardson et al., 2023)

Visual showing the 9 boundaries:

1. Climate change ❌
2. Biosphere integrity ❌
3. Land-system change ❌
4. Freshwater use ❌
5. Biogeochemical flows (N, P) ❌
6. Novel entities (chemicals, plastics) ❌
7. Ocean acidification ⚠️
8. Atmospheric aerosol loading ?
9. Stratospheric ozone depletion ✓

**6 of 9 boundaries already transgressed**

---

### SLIDE 7: Implications for Development

**The "safe operating space" for humanity is shrinking**

Key questions this raises:

- Can traditional development models continue?
- Is there still "space" for development in the Global South?
- What does "development" mean within planetary boundaries?
- How do we balance social needs and ecological limits?

---

## PART 2: DOUGHNUT ECONOMICS (15 minutes)

### SLIDE 8: The Doughnut Economics Framework
**Kate Raworth's Visual Model**

[Show the doughnut diagram]

**Two boundaries:**

- **Inner ring**: Social foundation (12 dimensions)
- **Outer ring**: Ecological ceiling (9 planetary boundaries)

**The goal**: Stay in the "safe and just space" between the two

---

### SLIDE 9: The Social Foundation
**12 dimensions of human wellbeing** (connecting to capabilities approach, Session 3):

- Food
- Water
- Health
- Education
- Income and work
- Peace and justice
- Political voice
- Social equity
- Gender equality
- Housing
- Networks
- Energy

**These are basic capabilities people need to achieve**

---

### SLIDE 10: The Ecological Ceiling
**9 planetary boundaries** (connecting to Richardson et al.):

- Climate change
- Ocean acidification
- Chemical pollution
- Nitrogen & phosphorus loading
- Freshwater withdrawals
- Land conversion
- Biodiversity loss
- Air pollution
- Ozone layer depletion

**These are Earth system processes we cannot safely exceed**

---

### SLIDE 11: Where Do Countries Sit in the Doughnut?
**Empirical findings** (Fanning & Raworth, 2025)

[Show graph positioning countries]

**Key observation**: No country currently achieves social foundation without transgressing planetary boundaries

Examples:
- **High-income countries**: Meet social needs but overshoot ecological ceiling
- **Low-income countries**: Within ecological boundaries but fail social foundation
- **The doughnut sweet spot**: Mostly empty

---

### SLIDE 12: Critical Questions About the Doughnut

**1. Historical responsibility**
- Who created current ecological overshoot?
- Should boundaries be applied equally to all countries?

**2. Power relations** (Anvaari's decolonial Marxist critique)
- Does framework obscure structural inequalities?
- Does it assume all countries can/should reach same position?
- Missing: Colonial legacies, unequal exchange, global value chains

**3. Operationalization**
- How do we measure "fair shares" of ecological space?
- Who decides the thresholds?
- What policies would actually keep us in the doughnut?

---

### SLIDE 13: Doughnut Framework: Strengths and Limitations

**Strengths:**
- Intuitive visual communication
- Integrates social and ecological dimensions
- Connects to capabilities approach
- Moves beyond GDP as sole metric

**Limitations:**
- May understate political economy barriers
- Doesn't specify mechanisms for achieving balance
- Risk of depoliticization (technical framing of political problems)
- Limited attention to global power structures and historical responsibility

---

## PART 3: INTERACTIVE EXERCISE (20-25 minutes)

### SLIDE 14: Interactive Exercise - Setup
**Mapping Development Pathways**

**Your task:**
1. Analyze your assigned country's position (5 min individual)
2. Discuss as group (7 min)
3. Design a policy pathway (5 min)
4. Prepare 2-minute presentation

**Countries:**
- Group 1: Germany
- Group 2: Vietnam  
- Group 3: Kenya
- Group 4: Costa Rica
- Group 5: Saudi Arabia

[Distribute country fact sheets]

---

### SLIDE 15: Guiding Questions for Your Analysis

**Current position:**
- Where is your country in the doughnut? (Social foundation? Ecological overshoot?)
- What are main environmental pressures?
- What are main development priorities?

**Policy pathway:**
- Should your country pursue growth? Degrowth? Something else?
- What specific policies would move toward the doughnut?
- What are the main constraints? (Political, institutional, economic)

**Context matters:**
- How does your country's development level affect options?
- How do global power structures constrain choices?

---

### SLIDE 16: [BLANK - For Group Presentations]
**Group presentations and discussion**

[10 minutes total - 2 minutes per group]

---

### SLIDE 17: Synthesis from Exercise
**What we learned:**

Key insights from presentations:
- Different countries need different pathways
- Development level matters for policy options
- Historical responsibility vs. current capacity
- Institutional and political constraints vary
- Global structures shape national options

**This context-dependency will be key for understanding the growth/degrowth debate**

---

## PART 4: THE GROWTH/DEGROWTH CONTROVERSY (30 minutes)

### SLIDE 18: Framing the Debate
**What are we actually debating?**

**Important distinction** (Schmelzer, 2023):
- **GDP critiques**: GDP is bad measure (we covered this in Session 2)
- **Growth critiques**: Continuous GDP expansion is problematic

**This session focuses on growth critiques**

---

### SLIDE 19: What is Degrowth?
**According to Hickel (2020):**

Degrowth means:
- **In Global North**: Planned reduction of energy/material throughput
- **Not**: Recession, austerity, or poverty
- **Not**: Reduction of all economic activity equally
- **Goal**: Reduce ecologically destructive production while maintaining/improving wellbeing

**Key principle**: Selective degrowth in wealthy countries while enabling development in Global South

**Note**: Significant heterogeneity within degrowth movement (Trainer's critique)

---

### SLIDE 20: The Alternative: Green Growth
**The mainstream position:**

**Core claim**: We can continue GDP growth while reducing environmental impact

**Mechanism**: "Decoupling"
- Technological innovation
- Efficiency improvements
- Shift to services and knowledge economy
- Renewable energy transition
- Circular economy

**This relies on absolute decoupling: GDP ↑ while environmental impact ↓**

---

### SLIDE 21: The Decoupling Debate - Key Concepts

**Relative decoupling**: Environmental impact per unit GDP decreases
- Example: 5% GDP growth, 3% emissions growth = 2% relative decoupling
- **Not sufficient** - total impact still increases

**Absolute decoupling**: Total environmental impact decreases while GDP grows
- Example: 5% GDP growth, -2% emissions = absolute decoupling
- **This is what green growth requires**

**The question**: Is absolute decoupling happening at sufficient rates?

---

### SLIDE 22: The Empirical Evidence on Decoupling

**Historical trends:**
- Relative decoupling: Common in many areas
- Absolute decoupling: Rare and limited
  - Some success for local pollutants in wealthy countries
  - Little evidence for material throughput globally
  - No evidence for absolute decoupling at global scale across multiple dimensions

**Required rates for climate targets:**
- Need ~7-10% annual reduction in emissions
- Observed rates: At best 1-2% in few countries for limited time periods
- **Gap between required and observed rates is enormous**

---

### SLIDE 23: The Hickel-Kallis Position (2020)
**"Is Green Growth Possible?" - Their answer: No**

**Their argument:**
1. Historical evidence shows insufficient absolute decoupling
2. Technological improvements get offset by scale increases (Jevons paradox)
3. High-income countries show no evidence of absolute decoupling in material use
4. Required rates of decoupling are unprecedented and implausible

**Conclusion**: 
- Continued growth in Global North is incompatible with climate goals
- Need deliberate downscaling in wealthy countries
- Enable development in Global South within ecological limits

---

### SLIDE 24: The Warlenius Critique (2023)
**"What if Hickel and Kallis are right?"**

**Warlenius accepts their pessimism about decoupling, then asks:**
"What would degrowth have to look like to meet climate targets?"

**His calculations:**
- If decoupling is as limited as Hickel-Kallis claim
- Meeting 1.5°C target requires 4-6% annual GDP reduction in wealthy countries
- For 30+ years continuously
- This is **unprecedented** peacetime economic contraction

**His point**: This may be as politically unfeasible as green growth is technically unfeasible

---

### SLIDE 25: The Debate Continues
**Jackson, Hickel & Kallis response (2024) + Warlenius rejoinder (2025)**

**Hickel-Kallis response:**
- Warlenius uses overly pessimistic assumptions
- Degrowth doesn't mean GDP reduction alone - includes restructuring
- Some decoupling is possible, just not enough for continued growth
- Focus on wellbeing provisioning, not GDP

**Warlenius rejoinder:**
- His calculations follow from Hickel-Kallis's own empirical claims
- Gap between what's ecologically necessary and politically feasible remains
- Both green growth and degrowth face enormous implementation barriers

**Unresolved tension between ecological necessity and political feasibility**

---

### SLIDE 26: Beyond the Technical Debate
**This is fundamentally about political economy**

**Why does growth imperative persist?** (Connecting to Session 5 on institutions)
- Debt-based financial system requires growth
- Employment depends on growth (in current system)
- Political legitimacy tied to growth
- Corporate profit models based on expansion
- Power structures benefit from status quo

**Both green growth and degrowth require:**
- Massive institutional transformation
- Redistribution of power and resources
- International cooperation
- Challenge to vested interests

---

### SLIDE 27: What Does "Growth" Measure Anyway?
**Connecting back to Session 2**

**Reminder**: GDP measures:
- Market transactions
- Not wellbeing, not sustainability
- Can increase while actual welfare decreases

**Implications for debate:**
- Maybe GDP growth vs. degrowth is wrong framing?
- Should we focus on wellbeing provisioning instead?
- Can we restructure economies to meet needs without growth?

**But**: GDP is deeply embedded in political and economic institutions

---

### SLIDE 28: The North-South Dimension
**Who should degrow? Who should develop?**

**Key differentiation:**
- **Global North**: Ecological overshoot, high consumption levels
  - Case for selective degrowth or post-growth
  - Focus on sufficiency and redistribution
  
- **Global South**: Often within ecological boundaries but failing social foundation
  - Need development in capabilities and material conditions
  - But avoid replicating Northern consumption models

**Historical responsibility matters:**
- North created most cumulative emissions and environmental degradation
- Colonial and post-colonial resource extraction
- Unequal exchange continues

---

### SLIDE 29: Critical Synthesis of Growth/Degrowth Debate

**False dichotomy?**
- Not just "green growth" vs "degrowth"
- Multiple pathways possible depending on context

**Questions the debate reveals:**
1. What do we want to grow/shrink? (Not all economic activity is equal)
2. Growth/degrowth of what? (GDP vs. wellbeing vs. material throughput)
3. Who decides? (Democratic participation vs. technocratic solutions)
4. Who benefits/pays? (Distributional questions central)

**Power and discourse:**
- Who defines terms of debate?
- Whose voices are centered/marginalized?
- Connection to postcolonial critiques (Session 1)

---

## PART 5: SYNTHESIS & CONCLUSION (10 minutes)

### SLIDE 30: Connecting Across the Course
**How environmental limits challenge previous frameworks**

**Session 2 (Measurement):**
- If not GDP growth, what should we measure?
- Doughnut framework offers alternative metrics
- But measurement alone doesn't solve political economy problems

**Session 3 (Capabilities Approach):**
- Doughnut's social foundation ≈ basic capabilities
- Environmental limits affect capability achievement
- Need ecological capabilities framework?

---

### SLIDE 31: Connecting Across the Course (continued)

**Session 4 (Growth Models):**
- Solow model: Can technological progress overcome resource limits?
- Assumption of infinite substitutability between capital and resources
- Environmental economics challenges: Some resources have no substitutes
- Ecological economics: Economy as subsystem of finite biosphere

**Session 5 (Institutions):**
- What institutions enable/prevent sustainable transitions?
- Path dependencies and lock-ins
- Power structures that maintain growth imperative
- Need for institutional transformation

---

### SLIDE 32: Policy Dilemmas and Trade-offs
**No easy answers**

**Green growth pathway:**
- **Advantages**: Politically easier, builds on existing institutions, less disruptive
- **Challenges**: Insufficient evidence it works at required scale, time running out
- **Risks**: Continued ecological overshoot while pursuing technological fixes

**Degrowth pathway:**
- **Advantages**: Directly addresses overconsumption, aligns means with ends
- **Challenges**: Politically difficult, requires radical restructuring, implementation unclear
- **Risks**: Economic disruption without careful management

**Doughnut-guided approach:**
- **Advantages**: Comprehensive framework, context-sensitive
- **Challenges**: How to actually achieve it? Political economy barriers
- **Risks**: Becomes aspirational diagram without transformative action

---

### SLIDE 33: What Would Different Policies Look Like?

**Green growth approach:**
- Massive investment in renewable energy and green technology
- Carbon pricing and emissions trading
- Circular economy policies
- Energy efficiency standards
- Maintain growth trajectory while reducing emissions intensity

**Degrowth approach:**
- Working time reduction
- Universal basic services
- Caps on resource extraction and emissions
- Luxury taxes and progressive taxation
- Democratic planning of production priorities

**Context-specific approaches:**
- Different policies for different countries (as our exercise showed)
- Global North: Focus on sufficiency and redistribution
- Global South: Sustainable development pathways
- Requires international cooperation and transfer of resources/technology

---

### SLIDE 34: The Implementation Challenge
**Political economy of transitions**

**Who bears the costs?**
- Workers in fossil fuel industries
- Communities dependent on extractive industries
- Consumers facing higher prices
- Need for just transition policies

**Who has power to block/enable change?**
- Fossil fuel corporations and financial interests
- Political institutions dependent on growth for legitimacy
- International power structures
- But also: Social movements, changing norms, crisis moments

**Path dependencies:**
- Infrastructure lock-ins (transport, energy, housing)
- Institutional lock-ins (financial system, employment models)
- Cognitive lock-ins (growth = progress equation)

---

### SLIDE 35: Key Takeaways

1. **Development and environment are inseparably linked** - bidirectional causality

2. **The doughnut framework** offers intuitive visualization of the challenge - but doesn't resolve political economy tensions

3. **The growth/degrowth debate** reveals fundamental tensions between ecological necessity and political feasibility

4. **Decoupling is insufficient** at observed rates - but required degrowth rates also pose enormous challenges

5. **Context matters enormously** - different pathways for countries at different development levels

6. **This is ultimately about power** - who decides, who benefits, who pays?

7. **No perfect solutions exist** - only difficult choices with trade-offs

---

### SLIDE 36: Final Reflection
**THE development challenge of our time**

We face a **trilemma**:
- Ecological sustainability
- Social justice and development
- Political feasibility

**We cannot avoid choosing:**
- Business as usual → ecological collapse
- Green growth → unproven at required scale
- Degrowth → unprecedented political challenge

**The question is not which is perfect, but which direction to move**

Different contexts require different strategies - but all require confronting power structures and transforming institutions

---
