| **Health** | 1. Population living in countries with under-5 mortality rate exceeding 25 per 1,000 live births<br>2. Population living in countries without high coverage of essential health services (Universal Health Coverage Index score less than 60 out of 100) |
| **Education** | 1. Adult population (aged 15+ years) who are illiterate<br>2. Young adult population (aged 21-23 years) with incomplete upper secondary education |

## 🎯 Interactive and follow-up exercises

-   ...

Both exercises contain elements to be done in class, as well as follow-up elements, which can help you to deepen to topics of this lecture.

Below you also find two possible 'solutions', although it is entirely possible to come up with different assessments.

-   TBA
