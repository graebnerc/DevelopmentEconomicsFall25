# Post-Lecture Reflection

Now that you've learned about **Amartya Sen's** and **Martha Nussbaum's** approaches to capabilities, reflect on the exercise we did at the beginning of class.

# Question 1: Comparing Your List to Nussbaum's

**Martha Nussbaum's 10 Central Capabilities:**

1. Life (being able to live a normal lifespan)
2. Bodily health (including nourishment, shelter)
3. Bodily integrity (freedom of movement, security, reproductive choice)
4. Senses, imagination, and thought (education, expression)
5. Emotions (being able to love, grieve, feel)
6. Practical reason (being able to form conception of good life)
7. Affiliation (being able to live with others, social respect)
8. Other species (being able to live with concern for nature)
9. Play (being able to laugh, enjoy recreation)
10. Control over one's environment (political and material)
