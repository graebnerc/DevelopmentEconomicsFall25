## Overall Goal of the Course

You will know the most influential theories about the determinants of socio-economic
development. You will be able to identify and reflect on the ideas of 'progress' and 'good life'
underlying these theories. Moreover, you will learn to reproduce and evaluate the common patterns of
argumentation on the relationship between 'development', 'economic growth' and 'planetary boundaries'.

## Learning Goals

Upon completion of this seminar, you will be able to:

**Expertise:**

- Define and critically evaluate the most important concepts of (sustainable) economic development and commonly used development indicators
- Critically question and assess different approaches to defining and measuring development
- Evaluate policy measures in terms of their expected impact on economic development and identify their underlying theoretical foundations

**Methodological Competence:**

- Independently collect development data from publicly available sources and use it to analyze determinants and implications of economic development
- Identify and evaluate the theories underlying development programs and policies
- Apply both empirical and theoretical methods from development economics to analyze development-related problems and critically assess them

**Social and Personal Skills:**

- Critically question common notions of 'development' and articulate and justify your own ideas about appropriate definitions and measurements of economic development
- Describe current debates on development policy and take well-founded positions on concrete development policy measures
- Identify the data necessary to answer development theory questions and, when needed, acquire and analyze this data yourself while explaining your findings
