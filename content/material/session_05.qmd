## Abstract

This session explores the "development puzzle" - why countries with similar geography, resources, and colonial heritage can have vastly different development outcomes. Institutional economics pretents to have found the answer! We examine two competing paradigms in institutional economics: Original Institutional Economics (OIE), with its evolutionary and critical approach, and New Institutional Economics (NIE), which integrates institutions into mainstream economic theory.

## Optional Exercise

Compare and contrast Original Institutional Economics (OIE) and New Institutional Economics (NIE) approaches. Focus on:

- Different conceptions of actors (socially embedded vs. rational optimizer)
- Views on institutional change (evolutionary vs. efficiency-driven)
- Treatment of power and inequality
- Policy implications of each approach

Which approach do you find more convincing for understanding development challenges, and why? (400 words)
