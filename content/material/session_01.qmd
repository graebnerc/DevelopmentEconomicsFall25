## Abstract

In this introductory lecture we discuss four "grand theories" that all give different answers to the question of "What is development?".
As we will see throughout this course, the fundamental ideas of these four approaches continue to shape - implicitly or explicitly - the discourses about the rights and wrongs of development policy.
