## Abstract

This session explores development through Marxist and dependency theory perspectives, offering a critical alternative to mainstream growth models and institutional economics. We examine how Marxist analysis reframes the "development puzzle" not as a question of why some countries lag behind, but why development and underdevelopment are connected processes within a global capitalist system.

The session progresses through three main analytical steps: First, we explore the historical transition from pre-capitalist to capitalist modes of production, emphasizing primitive accumulation and the violent transformation of social relations. Second, we analyze uneven development *within* capitalism, examining how core-periphery dynamics, unequal exchange, and world-systems structure create persistent global inequality. Finally, we engage with dependency theory's policy implications and contemporary relevance, connecting these debates to issues of trade, technology, and ecological sustainability that we'll explore in subsequent sessions.

Unlike Sessions 4 (growth models) and 5 (institutional economics), which largely assume countries develop independently through similar processes, Marxist perspectives insist that development in some places is intrinsically linked to underdevelopment in others. This fundamentally challenges both the convergence predictions of neoclassical models and the "global standard institutions" approach of New Institutional Economics.

## Emmanuel's Unequal Exchange: Wage Differentials with Equal Productivity

### The Setup

Imagine two countries trading with each other:

- **Core country**: Produces machines
- **Periphery country**: Produces coffee

**Key assumption**: Both countries have equal labor productivity (same hours needed per unit)

### Step 1: Production in the Core

Core produces machines:

- Labor productivity: 1 machine requires 100 labor hours
- Wage rate: \$20 per hour
- Labor value created: 100 hours × \$20/hour = \$2,000

**Result**: One machine embodies 100 labor hours and has a value of \$2,000

### Step 2: Production in the Periphery

Periphery produces coffee:

- Labor productivity: 1 ton of coffee requires 100 labor hours (same as core!)
- Wage rate: \$2 per hour
- Labor value created: 100 hours × \$2/hour = \$200

**Result**: One ton of coffee embodies 100 labor hours and has a value of \$200

### Step 3: The Exchange

For trade to occur at equal monetary value, we need to balance the exchange:

- Core exports: 1 machine = \$2,000
- Periphery must export: \$2,000 ÷ \$200 per ton = **10 tons of coffee**

### Step 4: Calculating Labor Hour Transfer

Labor hours embodied in the exchange:

- Core gives: 1 machine = 100 labor hours
- Periphery gives: 10 tons coffee = 10 × 100 hours = 1,000 labor hours

**Net transfer**: 1,000 hours - 100 hours = **900 labor hours**

### Step 5: The Unequal Exchange

What this means:

|  | Core | Periphery |
|---|---|---|
| Monetary value traded | \$2,000 | \$2,000 |
| Labor hours traded | 100 hours | 1,000 hours |
| Appears equal? | ✓ Yes (in money) | ✓ Yes (in money) |
| Actually equal? | ✗ No (in labor) | ✗ No (in labor) |

**The periphery must work 10 times longer than the core to obtain the same product, despite having equal productivity.**

### Emmanuel's Key Insight

- **The cause**: Wage differentials (10:1 ratio) create unequal exchange even when productivity is identical.
- **The mechanism**: Low wages in the periphery mean each labor hour creates less monetary value, even though it represents the same amount of work.
- **Policy implication**: Strengthen labor movements in the periphery to raise wages toward core levels.

## Amin's Unequal Exchange: Productivity Gaps + Monopoly Power

### The Setup

Amin argues Emmanuel's analysis is too optimistic. The periphery faces **three sources of exploitation**:

1. Lower wages
2. Lower productivity (technology gap)
3. Monopoly pricing in core vs. competitive pricing in periphery

### Step 1: Production in the Core (High Productivity + Monopoly)

Core produces machines with advanced technology:

- Labor productivity: 1 machine requires only **50 labor hours** (advanced technology!)
- Wage rate: \$20 per hour
- Production cost (labor value): 50 hours × \$20/hour = \$1,000
- Market structure: **Monopoly**
- Selling price: \$2,000 (100% markup above labor value)

**Result**: One machine embodies 50 labor hours, costs \$1,000 to produce, but sells for \$2,000

### Step 2: Production in the Periphery (Low Productivity + Competition)

Periphery produces coffee with old technology:

- Labor productivity: 1 ton of coffee requires **200 labor hours** (old technology!)
- Wage rate: \$2 per hour
- Production cost (labor value): 200 hours × \$2/hour = \$400
- Market structure: **Competitive**
- Selling price: \$400 (price = cost, no markup possible)

**Result**: One ton of coffee embodies 200 labor hours and sells for \$400

### Step 3: The Exchange

For trade to occur at equal monetary value:

- Core exports: 1 machine = \$2,000
- Periphery must export: \$2,000 ÷ \$400 per ton = **5 tons of coffee**

### Step 4: Calculating Labor Hour Transfer

Labor hours embodied in the exchange:

- Core gives: 1 machine = 50 labor hours
- Periphery gives: 5 tons coffee = 5 × 200 hours = 1,000 labor hours

**Net transfer**: 1,000 hours - 50 hours = **950 labor hours**

### Step 5: Calculating Monopoly Rent

Monopoly rent extraction:

- Core's production cost: 50 hours × \$20 = \$1,000 (labor value)
- Core's selling price: \$2,000
- **Monopoly rent**: \$2,000 - \$1,000 = **\$1,000**

This \$1,000 is pure surplus extracted through monopoly pricing power.

### Step 6: The Double Exploitation

What this means:

|  | Core | Periphery |
|---|---|---|
| Monetary value traded | \$2,000 | \$2,000 |
| Labor hours traded | 50 hours | 1,000 hours |
| Ratio of labor hours | 1× | 20× |
| Price vs. value | Sells above value (+\$1,000) | Sells at value (no markup) |

**The periphery must work 20 times longer than the core to obtain the same product.**

Two sources of exploitation:

1. **Labor transfer**: 950 hours of unpaid labor
2. **Monopoly rent**: \$1,000 of surplus value extracted through pricing power

### Amin's Key Insight

**The causes (multiple)**:

- Technology gap: Periphery needs 4× more labor per unit (200 hrs vs 50 hrs)
- Wage gap: Still present (10:1 ratio)
- Market power: Core has monopolies, periphery faces competition

**The mechanism**:

- Periphery trapped in low-productivity sectors (old technology)
- Core controls high-productivity sectors AND can charge monopoly prices
- Even if periphery wages rise, technology and monopoly gaps remain

**Policy implication**: Must transform production structure and break monopolies, not just raise wages.

## Comparing Emmanuel and Amin

### Key Differences

| Factor | Emmanuel | Amin |
|---|---|---|
| Productivity gap? | No (both 100 hrs/unit) | Yes (200 vs 50 hrs/unit) |
| Wage gap? | Yes (\$2 vs \$20) | Yes (\$2 vs \$20) |
| Monopoly power? | Not emphasized | Yes (core monopoly) |
| Labor transfer | 900 hours | 950 hours |
| Additional rent | — | +\$1,000 monopoly rent |
| Total exploitation ratio | 10:1 | 20:1 |

### Emmanuel's Framework

**What creates unequal exchange**:

- Wage differentials alone (10:1 ratio)

**Core assumption**:

- Equal productivity is possible/achievable

**Why periphery loses**:

- Low wages mean each labor hour creates less monetary value

**Solution**:

- Strengthen labor movements
- Raise periphery wages toward core levels
- Problem is political/institutional, not structural


### Amin's Framework

**What creates unequal exchange**:

- Productivity gap (4:1 ratio)
- Wage gap (10:1 ratio)
- Monopoly power (100% markup)

**Core assumption**:

- Productivity gap is structural, not temporary

**Why periphery loses**:

- Trapped in low-productivity sectors
- Faces competitive markets (no pricing power)
- Must buy from monopolistic core

**Solution**:

- Transform production structure
- Develop technological capacity
- Break dependency on core technology
- Problem is structural, requires systemic change

**Visual summary**:

```
Productivity Gap + Wage Gap + Monopoly = Severe Unequal Exchange
   (4× worse)      ($2 vs $20)  (100% markup)  (950 hrs + $1,000 rent)
```

### Theoretical Implications

**Emmanuel is more optimistic**:

- Gap is primarily wages (political/institutional)
- Can be closed through labor organization
- Trade itself isn't the fundamental problem
- Integration can work if wages equalize

**Amin is more pessimistic**:

- Gap is structural (technology + monopoly + wages)
- Cannot be closed through wage increases alone
- Trade perpetuates structural subordination
- May require delinking or radical transformation

### Policy Implications

**If Emmanuel is right**:

- **Focus on**: Labor rights, minimum wages, union organization
- **Strategy**: Progressive integration with strong labor protections
- **Assumption**: Market forces can work if labor is empowered
- **Timeline**: Potentially achievable in medium term

**If Amin is right**:

- **Focus on**: Industrial policy, technology development, breaking monopolies
- **Strategy**: Selective delinking, building autonomous productive capacity
- **Assumption**: Market forces alone perpetuate subordination
- **Timeline**: Long-term structural transformation needed
