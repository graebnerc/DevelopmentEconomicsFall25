## Abstract

This session explores development through Marxist and dependency theory perspectives, offering a critical alternative to mainstream growth models and institutional economics. We examine how Marxist analysis reframes the "development puzzle" not as a question of why some countries lag behind, but why development and underdevelopment are connected processes within a global capitalist system.

The session progresses through three main analytical steps: First, we explore the historical transition from pre-capitalist to capitalist modes of production, emphasizing primitive accumulation and the violent transformation of social relations. Second, we analyze uneven development *within* capitalism, examining how core-periphery dynamics, unequal exchange, and world-systems structure create persistent global inequality. Finally, we engage with dependency theory's policy implications and contemporary relevance, connecting these debates to issues of trade, technology, and ecological sustainability that we'll explore in subsequent sessions.

Unlike Sessions 4 (growth models) and 5 (institutional economics), which largely assume countries develop independently through similar processes, Marxist perspectives insist that development in some places is intrinsically linked to underdevelopment in others. This fundamentally challenges both the convergence predictions of neoclassical models and the "global standard institutions" approach of New Institutional Economics.
