## Overview

One of the most striking predictions of the Solow-Swan model is **absolute convergence**: poor countries should grow faster than rich countries due to diminishing returns to capital, eventually leading all economies to the same income level.

Your task is to test this prediction empirically using real-world data from the Penn World Tables.

## What You Need

### Required packages

  - `haven` (for reading Stata files)
  - `dplyr` (data manipulation)
  - `ggplot2` (visualization)
  - `tidyr` (data reshaping)
  - `broom` (regression results)

### Data Source

- **Penn World Tables 11.0**: Download `pwt110.dta` from [https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/)
- Save the file in your R working directory

## The Convergence Test

You will estimate this regression equation:

$$\frac{1}{T} \ln\left(\frac{y_{i,t+T}}{y_{i,t}}\right) = \alpha + \beta \ln(y_{i,t}) + \epsilon_i$$

**Interpretation**: 

The crucial parameter to test is the *convergence parameter* $\beta$:

- If $\beta < 0$: Countries with lower initial income grow faster $\rightarrow$ **Convergence**
- If $\beta > 0$: Rich countries grow faster $\rightarrow$ **Divergence**

Thus, the prediction of the Solow-Swan model is that $\beta$ is significantly smaller than zero.

## Analysis Requirements

There are different ways to test for convergence. In particular, you may vary the time horizon and the countries considered.

We suggest you test convergence for:

1. **Time Periods**:
   - 1960-1990 (30 years)
   - 1990-2022 (32 years)

2. **Country Samples**:
   - All countries with complete data (the Solow-Swan case)
   - OECD countries only (the case of *conditional* convergence)

What you should produce for every case:

   - Regression results ($\beta$ coefficient, $p$-value, $R^2$)
   - Scatter plots with trend lines
   - Economic interpretation of findings

This exercise demonstrates how theoretical predictions from growth models perform when confronted with empirical evidence - a crucial skill in development economics research.
