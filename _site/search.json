    "text": "How do we measure something as abstract as “institutions”? This fundamental challenge has puzzled economists and political scientists for decades. While we can observe the outcomes of institutional arrangements - economic growth, political stability, or corruption scandals - measuring the quality of institutions themselves is far more complex. Not only, but also because the definition of an institution differs across economic paradigms, as discussed in this lecture.\nThe Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI), developed by the World Bank, represent one of the most influential attempts to quantify institutional quality. Since 1996, the WGI have provided standardized measures of governance across more than 200 countries, influencing everything from aid allocation to academic research on development.\n\n\nInstitutional measurement isn’t merely an academic exercise. The WGI and similar indicators shape real-world decisions:\n\nDevelopment aid allocation increasingly depends on governance scores\nForeign investment flows are influenced by institutional quality rankings\nPolicy reforms are often designed to improve specific governance indicators\nAcademic research on institutions and development relies heavily on these measures\n\nUnderstanding both the power and limitations of institutional indicators is crucial for anyone studying development economics.\n\n\n\nThis tutorial introduces you to the WGI framework while maintaining a critical perspective on institutional measurement. You’ll learn how to access and analyze WGI data, understand what these indicators capture and miss, and connect them to broader debates in institutional economics.\nRather than treating the WGI as objective truth, we’ll explore how these measures reflect particular theoretical assumptions about what constitutes “good governance” - assumptions that may not apply universally across different contexts and development models."

Important institutional dimensions like labor relations, welfare systems, and industrial policy are notably absent.\nThis critique mirrors the discussion of Acemoglu, Johnson & Robinson’s work in the institutional economics lecture, where we saw how their focus on “Global Standard Institutions” reflects a narrow, Western-centric view of good governance that may not be universally applicable."

    "text": "2.3 Theory-Ladenness of Institutional Measurement\nThe previous exercise shows that the WGI framework is far from neutral but rather embeds particular assumptions about good governance:\n\nMarket-friendly bias: Regulatory Quality heavily emphasizes policies that facilitate private business, potentially overlooking the value of regulations that protect workers, consumers, or the environment.\nLiberal democratic model: Voice & Accountability measures primarily capture Western-style democratic procedures, potentially missing other forms of legitimate political participation.\nStability bias: Political Stability may inadvertently favor authoritarian regimes that maintain order at the expense of necessary social change.\nIndividual vs. systemic focus: Control of Corruption emphasizes petty corruption while potentially missing “legal corruption” through campaign finance, lobbying, or regulatory capture.\n\nCorrespondingly, there are several important institutional dimensions that receive little attention in the WGI framework, such as:\n\nLabor institutions: Union rights, collective bargaining, worker protection\nWelfare institutions: Social insurance, redistribution mechanisms\nIndustrial policy institutions: State capacity for economic transformation\nEnvironmental governance: Institutions for ecological sustainability\nGender institutions: Formal and informal rules affecting women’s participation\n\nThese omissions reflect the WGI’s origins in the “good governance” agenda of the 1990s and the newer ‘Global Standard Institutions’, which prioritized market-friendly reforms over broader institutional development."

The relationship with inequality is, surprisingly, much less clear and tends to be even negative.\nBut even the positive correlation with GDP does not answer the corresponding questions:\n\nDo good institutions cause development? This is the core claim of New Institutional Economics, supported by studies like Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson’s colonial origins work.\nDoes development enable better institutions? Alternative explanations suggest that economic growth provides resources for institutional improvements.\nDo both reflect common factors? Historical, cultural, or geographic factors might simultaneously influence both institutional quality and development outcomes.\nReverse causation concerns: Successful development may make countries appear to have better governance simply because they can afford better public services and less corruption.\n\nAll these intricacies make institutional analysis a very challenging but also very exciting subject."

    "text": "Key Takeaways\nInstitutions clearly matter for development, but measuring them objectively is extraordinarily difficult. The WGI represent an ambitious attempt to quantify governance quality, but they embed particular theoretical assumptions about what constitutes good institutions.\nThe WGI framework aligns closely with New Institutional Economics concerns about property rights, transaction costs, and market-friendly policies. However, it largely overlooks Original Institutional Economics themes around power relations, social embeddedness, and institutional change.\nHigh correlations among WGI dimensions on the aggregate suggest they may measure a single underlying “governance quality” factor rather than truly distinct institutional aspects.\nHeterogeneous correlations on the country level, on the other hand, suggest that it is very important to look at single countries more closely to understand the specific relationship between the measured dimensions.\nStrong correlations between governance and development don’t establish causal relationships. The direction of causation remains hotly debated in the literature."

Most desirable? Why?\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nQuestion 4: Contemporary Relevance\nAre these theories from the 1960s-70s still relevant today, or has globalization fundamentally changed the dynamics?\nConsider:\n\nNew forms of value extraction (data, intellectual property, platform economy)\nClimate crisis and “green” extractivism\nRise of China and changing global hierarchy\nNew forms of dependency (technological, financial, digital)\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nNote: These cases are designed to help you apply abstract theoretical concepts to concrete contemporary situations. The goal is not to find “correct” answers but to practice theoretical analysis and recognize patterns of exploitation and dependency in the modern global economy."

    "text": "On April 24, 2013, the Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh collapsed, killing over 1,100 garment workers and injuring more than 2,500. The building housed several garment factories producing clothes for major Western brands. Despite visible cracks appearing the day before, workers were ordered to return to work under threat of lost wages.\nBangladesh is the world’s second-largest garment exporter after China. The industry employs over 4 million workers (mostly women) who earn among the world’s lowest wages - approximately $95-100 per month at the time of the collapse. Western retailers benefit from these low labor costs, while Bangladeshi factory owners compete intensely for contracts by minimizing costs.\nYour task: Analyze this situation through two different theoretical lenses - New Institutional Economics (NIE) and Marxist Development Theory. How would each framework explain what happened and why?"

We examine how Marxist analysis reframes the “development puzzle” not as a question of why some countries lag behind, but why development and underdevelopment are connected processes within a global capitalist system.\nThe session progresses through three main analytical steps: First, we explore the historical transition from pre-capitalist to capitalist modes of production, emphasizing primitive accumulation and the violent transformation of social relations. Second, we analyze uneven development within capitalism, examining how core-periphery dynamics, unequal exchange, and world-systems structure create persistent global inequality. Finally, we engage with dependency theory’s policy implications and contemporary relevance, connecting these debates to issues of trade, technology, and ecological sustainability that we’ll explore in subsequent sessions.\nUnlike Sessions 4 (growth models) and 5 (institutional economics), which largely assume countries develop independently through similar processes, Marxist perspectives insist that development in some places is intrinsically linked to underdevelopment in others. This fundamentally challenges both the convergence predictions of neoclassical models and the “global standard institutions” approach of New Institutional Economics.",

    "text": "The Solow-Swan model makes one of the most striking predictions in development economics: absolute convergence. According to this model, poor countries should grow faster than rich countries because of diminishing returns to capital, leading all economies to eventually converge to the same level of income per capita.\nThis prediction emerges from two key assumptions:\n\nDiminishing returns to capital: As countries accumulate more capital, additional units of capital become less productive\nFactor mobility: Capital and technology can flow freely between countries\n\nThe mathematical intuition is straightforward: if the marginal product of capital is higher in poor countries (due to lower capital stock), then investment should flow there, generating higher growth rates until all countries reach the same steady state.\nBut does this prediction hold in reality? In this session’s exercise, you were asked to test the absolute convergence hypothesis using real-world data from the Penn World Tables. Below you find a possible solution for this exercise.\n\n\nWe test absolute convergence by estimating the following regression:\n\\[\\frac{1}{T} \\ln\\left(\\frac{y_{i,t+T}}{y_{i,t}}\\right) = \\alpha + \\beta \\ln(y_{i,t}) + \\epsilon_i\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{T} \\ln\\left(\\frac{y_{i,t+T}}{y_{i,t}}\\right)\\) is the average annual growth rate of GDP per capita over period T\n\\(y_{i,t}\\) is initial GDP per capita\n\\(\\beta\\) is the convergence parameter\n\nAbsolute convergence occurs if \\(\\beta &lt; 0\\): countries with lower initial income grow faster."

Poor countries should grow faster than rich countries.\n\nOur Results:\n\nThe evidence for absolute convergence is mixed at best and depends heavily on the sample\nFor a global sample, absolute convergence is not happening\nThe group of OECD countries show stronger convergence patterns than the global sample, but only for the more recent time period the convergence parameter is significantly smaller than zero\nEven in this, the relationship is often weak (low R-squared values)\n\nWhy is it that absolute convergence is not happening as predicted by Solow-Swan? The great thing about such models is that we can systematically think about which of its assumptions might not hold:\n\nDifferent Technologies: Countries may not have access to the same production technologies\nInstitutional Differences: Legal systems, property rights, and governance quality vary dramatically\nHuman Capital: Education and skill levels differ substantially across countries\nSavings Rates: Cultural and policy differences affect investment rates\nTrade and Openness: Some countries are more integrated into global markets\nGeography and Natural Resources: Location and resource endowments matter\nPatterns of exploitation: Maybe the success of some countries comes at the expense of other countires that would then not converge for obvious reasons.\n\nThe weak evidence for absolute convergence has led economists to focus on conditional convergence - the idea that countries converge to their own steady states, which may differ based on:\n\nSavings rates\nPopulation growth rates\n\nInstitutional quality\nHuman capital levels\nTechnology access\n\nAs you see, this addresses some of the possible explanations above. Other economists, especially those working in Marxist and Dependency Theory traditions would be even more skeptical, and argue for a systematic relationship between development and underdevelopment, suggesting that studying conditional convergence is not a fruitful endeavor either."

We examine how Marxist analysis reframes the “development puzzle” not as a question of why some countries lag behind, but why development and underdevelopment are connected processes within a global capitalist system.\nThe session progresses through three main analytical movements: First, we explore the historical transition from pre-capitalist to capitalist modes of production, emphasizing primitive accumulation and the violent transformation of social relations. Second, we analyze uneven development within capitalism, examining how core-periphery dynamics, unequal exchange, and world-systems structure create persistent global inequality. Finally, we engage with dependency theory’s policy implications and contemporary relevance, connecting these debates to issues of trade, technology, and ecological sustainability that we’ll explore in subsequent sessions.\nUnlike Sessions 4 (growth models) and 5 (institutional economics), which largely assume countries develop independently through similar processes, Marxist perspectives insist that development in some places is intrinsically linked to underdevelopment in others.

    "text": "🏛️ Part 1: Marxism 101 - Core Concepts for Development\n\n1.1 Historical Materialism and Modes of Production\nCentral idea: The way societies organize production and distribution of goods fundamentally shapes everything else in society - politics, culture, ideas, power structures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhat is a “Mode of Production”? A Simple Explanation\n\n\n\nThink of a mode of production as the economic system that defines how a society works at its most basic level. It has two main components:\n1. FORCES OF PRODUCTION = The stuff you use to make things - Technology and tools (plows vs. tractors vs. robots) - Natural resources (land, minerals, water) - Human knowledge and skills - Labor power (people’s ability to work)\n2. RELATIONS OF PRODUCTION = The rules about who owns what and who gets what - Who owns the tools, land, factories? (property relations) - Who does the actual work? - Who controls the surplus (the extra stuff produced beyond bare survival)? - How is that surplus extracted? (force? wages? rent?)\nTogether, these create the basic “operating system” of society.\n\n\nThree key modes relevant for development:\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    A[Pre-Capitalist&lt;br/&gt;Feudalism, Slavery] --&gt;|Primitive&lt;br/&gt;Accumulation| B[Capitalism&lt;br/&gt;Wage Labor]\n    B --&gt;|Internal&lt;br/&gt;Contradictions| C[Post-Capitalist&lt;br/&gt;Socialism?]\n    \n    style A fill:#e8f4f8\n    style B fill:#fff4e6\n    style C fill:#f0f0f0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantKey Difference from Rostow’s Stages (Session 1)\n\n\n\nRostow’s stages: Linear, universal path all societies follow (traditional → take-off → maturity → mass consumption)\nMarx’s modes:\n\nDialectical: Each mode contains internal contradictions that drive change\nNot universal: Different societies may skip stages or combine modes\nNot inevitable progress: Transitions involve conflict, violence, regression possible\nQualitative transformation: Not just more production but different social relations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteConcrete Example 1: Feudal Mode of Production (Medieval Europe, ~1000-1500 CE)\n\n\n\n\n\nFORCES OF PRODUCTION:\n\nSimple technology: Wooden plows, hand tools, watermills\nAnimal power (horses, oxen) for farming\nMostly human labor, very little machinery\nKnowledge passed down through guilds, limited literacy\n\nRELATIONS OF PRODUCTION:\n\nWho owns? Lords own land; peasants have customary rights to use it\nWho works? Peasants farm the land\nWho gets surplus? Lords extract surplus through:\n\nRent (portion of harvest)\nForced labor (peasants must work lord’s fields X days/week)\nTaxes and fees (use of mill, legal fees)\n\nHow extracted? Extra-economic coercion = Legal obligations, backed by force\n\nPeasants legally bound to land (serfdom)\nLords have military power, courts, prisons\n\n\nThe result: A hierarchical society where:\n\nSocial class determined by birth\nPeasants can’t leave without permission\nChurch and nobility justify system ideologically (“divine order”)\nLimited markets, mostly local self-sufficiency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteConcrete Example 2: Capitalist Mode of Production (Modern economy, ~1800-present)\n\n\n\n\n\nFORCES OF PRODUCTION:\n\nAdvanced technology: Factories, computers, automation, AI\nFossil fuels and electricity power machines\nComplex division of labor, specialized skills\nConstant technological innovation (competitive necessity)\n\nRELATIONS OF PRODUCTION:\n\nWho owns? Capitalists own means of production (factories, patents, capital)\nWho works? Workers own nothing but their labor power\nWho gets surplus? Capitalists appropriate surplus value as profit\nHow extracted? Through the wage relation (appears voluntary):\n\nWorkers “free” to sell labor power (no legal bondage)\nBut must work to survive (separated from means of production)\nCapitalist pays wage &lt; value of what workers produce\nDifference = surplus value (profit)\n\n\nThe result: A market society where:\n\nLabor power is a commodity (bought/sold like any other)\nProduction for profit, not for use\nCompetitive compulsion drives innovation\nAppears voluntary/free (no visible coercion) but worker has no real choice\nCapital accumulation becomes the driving force\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteConcrete Example 3: A Shoe Workshop - Feudal vs. Capitalist\n\n\n\n\n\nFEUDAL SHOEMAKER (15th century):\nForces of production:\n\nHand tools (awls, needles, knives)\nSmall workshop in home\nLeather bought from tanner\nCraft knowledge learned through apprenticeship\n\nRelations of production:\n\nMaster shoemaker OWNS his tools and workshop\nWorks with 1-2 apprentices\nMakes shoes to order for customers\nKeeps all profit after paying guild fees and taxes to lord\nControls his own work process and pace\n\nSurplus extraction:\n\nLord/king extracts through taxes (20% of income)\nGuild extracts membership fees\nBut shoemaker controls most of surplus he produces\n\n\nCAPITALIST SHOE FACTORY (19th century):\nForces of production:\n\nSewing machines, cutting machines\nLarge factory with 100 workers\nAssembly line division of labor\nEach worker does one repetitive task\n\nRelations of production:\n\nFactory owner OWNS machines, building, raw materials\nWorkers own NOTHING but their ability to work\nWorkers paid daily wage (say, $2/day)\nEach worker might produce 10 pairs of shoes per day\nThose shoes sell for $30 total\nOwner’s profit = $30 - $2 (wage) - $10 (materials) = $18/worker/day\n\nSurplus extraction:\n\nThrough wage relation: Worker paid $2, produces $30 value\nAppears fair (“a day’s wage for a day’s work”)\nBut workers have no choice - can’t access tools/materials without capitalist\nSurplus ($18) goes to owner as profit\n\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters for Development:\nDifferent modes ask different questions:\n\nFeudalism asks: How can lords extract more from peasants? How to maintain social hierarchy?\nCapitalism asks: How to maximize profit? How to compete with other capitalists? How to expand markets?\n\nFor development economics:\n\nUnderstanding modes helps us see that “development” = transformation of social relations, not just “getting richer”\nPre-capitalist → Capitalist transition required violent upheaval (enclosures, colonialism)\nCan’t understand contemporary development without understanding which mode dominates\nDifferent modes generate different class conflicts, different political struggles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningCommon Student Confusions Clarified\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: Is “mode of production” just another word for “economy”?\nA: No! It’s more fundamental. Two countries with market economies might have different modes:\n\nUSA 1850: Capitalist in North, slave-based in South (different modes)\nModern economy might combine multiple modes (capitalist factories + peasant farming + informal sector)\n\nQ: Do modes always follow a sequence: feudalism → capitalism → socialism?\nA: No! This is NOT a universal ladder:\n\nSome societies skipped feudalism (Africa, parts of Asia)\nCapitalism didn’t emerge everywhere the same way\nMany societies combine elements of different modes\nThe future is open, not predetermined\n\nQ: Are we still in “capitalist mode” even though we have the welfare state, regulations, etc.?\nA: Yes, as long as:\n\nMeans of production primarily privately owned\nLabor power bought/sold as commodity\nProduction for profit dominates\nWage relation is primary form of surplus extraction\n\nReforms and regulations happen WITHIN capitalism but don’t change the fundamental mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Class and Surplus Appropriation\nFundamental question: Who produces the surplus, and who controls it?\nPre-capitalist societies:\n\nDirect producers (peasants, artisans) control their means of production\nSurplus extracted through extra-economic coercion (taxes, rents, forced labor)\nExample: Feudal lord extracts surplus from peasants through legal obligations, not market mechanisms\n\nCapitalist societies:\n\nSeparation of producers from means of production\nWorkers sell labor power as a commodity\nSurplus extracted through wage relation (appears voluntary, contractual)\nCapitalist buys labor power, sells commodities produced, retains surplus value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipInteractive Element 2: Surplus Extraction Exercise (15 minutes)\n\n\n\nScenario: A shoe workshop in 19th century vs. modern shoe factory\n19th century artisan workshop:\n\nArtisan owns tools, workshop, raw materials\nProduces shoes, sells directly to customers\nControls entire surplus after costs\n\nModern factory:\n\nWorker owns only labor power\nSells 8 hours of work for daily wage\nProduces shoes worth more than daily wage\nCapitalist controls surplus\n\nQuestions for discussion:\n\nIn which system does the direct producer have more control over the surplus?\nWhich system appears more “free” contractually? Which offers more actual control?\nHow does this relate to “institutional quality” as measured in Session 5?\nCan you think of contemporary examples where these relations are contested? (Gig economy? Platform cooperatives?)\n\nBreakout groups (10 min): Discuss in groups of 4-5\nReport back (5 min): Key insights to class\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Capital Accumulation Dynamics\nThe circuit of capital: M - C - M’\n\nM: Money capital\nC: Commodities (labor power + means of production)\nM’: More money (original + surplus value)\n\nKey characteristics:\n\nNo natural limit: Unlike pre-capitalist production for use, capitalist production for exchange has no inherent endpoint\nCompetitive compulsion: Individual capitalist must reinvest surplus or be outcompeted\nConstant revolutionizing: Technology, organization, markets constantly disrupted\nSpatial expansion: When profitable opportunities exhausted locally, capital seeks new territories\n\nContrast with Solow model (Session 4):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolow Model\nMarxist Analysis\n\n\n\n\nAssumes stable steady state\nInherent dynamism, crisis tendency\n\n\nDiminishing returns → convergence\nUneven development, no convergence\n\n\nExogenous technology\nTechnology endogenous to class struggle\n\n\nHarmonious factors\nContradictory class interests\n\n\nIndividual country focus\nGlobal system analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Contradictions of Capitalism\nFour key contradictions relevant for development:\n\nTendency for profit rate to fall:\n\nRising productivity requires more machinery (constant capital) relative to labor (variable capital, source of surplus value)\nProfit rate = surplus value / total capital\nMore capital needed per unit output → falling rate of profit\nDrives spatial expansion (imperialism) seeking higher profit rates\n\nOverproduction crises:\n\nWorkers’ wages &lt; value of output produced\nRealization problem: Who buys the commodities?\nPeriodic crises of overproduction\nExport markets become crucial (links to imperialism)\n\nClass conflict:\n\nWage share vs. profit share zero-sum within capitalism\nConflicts over: working conditions, wages, control of production\nInstitutional outcomes reflect class power (not just “efficiency”)\n\nSpatial fixes:\n\nWhen accumulation opportunities exhausted domestically\nCapital flows to new territories\nCreates uneven geographical development\nLinks to imperialism and core-periphery dynamics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteConnection to Session 5: Institutions and Power\n\n\n\nNIE perspective (Acemoglu et al.):\n\nInstitutions are relatively stable rules that reduce transaction costs\n“Good” institutions protect property rights and encourage investment\nInstitutional quality determines development\n\nMarxist perspective:\n\nInstitutions embody class power relations\n“Good for whom?” - Property rights protect capital accumulation, may harm workers\nClass struggle shapes institutional evolution\nNo universal “good” institutions - depends on class perspective and development stage\n\nExample: Labor regulations\n\nNIE might see strict labor laws as “bad” institutions (increase costs, reduce flexibility)\nMarxist analysis: Labor laws reflect working-class power, protect against exploitation\nDevelopmental question: Which class interests does institution serve?"

Or does system require hierarchical division of labor?\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Structural Heterogeneity\nKey concept from structuralism (Prebisch, Furtado):\nCore economies:\n\nRelatively homogeneous productivity across sectors\nTechnology diffuses broadly\nLabor can move between sectors with similar productivity\nResult: Balanced, internally-integrated development\n\nPeripheral economies:\n\nDual structure: Advanced export enclaves + backward domestic sectors\nTechnology concentrated in enclaves (often foreign-owned)\nLabor surplus in backward sectors\nResult: Distorted, externally-dependent development\n\nExample: Latin American export economies (19th-20th centuries):\n\nAdvanced sector: Mining, plantation agriculture (foreign capital, modern technology)\nBackward sector: Subsistence peasants, informal urban economy\nSurplus from advanced sector extracted (repatriated profits, unequal exchange)\nLittle linkage between sectors\nContrast: European industrial development with forward/backward linkages\n\nPolicy implications:\n\nImport substitution industrialization (ISI) to create linkages\nReduce dependence on primary exports\nBuild integrated industrial structure\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Technological Dependence\nArgument (Prebisch, Amin, dependency theorists):\nCore countries:\n\nCenters of innovation\nGenerate new technologies\nCapture “technology rents” (temporary monopoly profits)\nMove to new products as old ones mature\n\nPeripheral countries:\n\nTechnology consumers/adapters\nProduce mature products with standardized technology\nLow profit margins (competitive)\nAlways behind technological frontier\n\nMechanisms reinforcing this:\n\nIntellectual property: Patents, licensing fees, royalties\nBrain drain: Educated workers migrate to core\nR&D concentration: Research facilities in core countries\nEducation systems: Peripheral systems train for existing technology, not innovation\n\nExample: Pharmaceutical industry\n\nCore: Drug discovery, clinical trials, patents (high value-added)\nPeriphery: Generic production (low value-added)\nEven if peripheral countries have production capacity, captured by patents\n\nLinks to contemporary debates:\n\nTechnology transfer for climate change mitigation\nCOVID vaccine patents and TRIPS waiver\nIndustrial policy and infant industry protection (Session 7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipInteractive Element 4: Global Value Chain Analysis (25 minutes)\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity: Analyzing the iPhone value chain\nMaterials: Provide students with data on iPhone production and value capture:\n\nDesign/software: California (Apple)\nComponents: Various (memory from South Korea, screen from South Korea/Japan, chips from Taiwan/USA)\nAssembly: China (Foxconn)\nMarketing/retail: Global (Apple)\n\nValue capture breakdown (example, 2016 iPhone):\n\nRetail price: $650\nApple profit: ~$300\nComponent costs: ~$225\nAssembly cost (China): ~$10\nOther: ~$115\n\nQuestions for group analysis:\n\nWhich countries capture most value? Which activities generate highest returns?\nWhat explains this distribution? Technology? Branding? Market power?\nCan China “move up the value chain”? What would that require? Who might resist?\nHow does this relate to unequal exchange? Is labor time equal to value captured?\nApply Economic Complexity logic: Why doesn’t assembling complex products make you complex?\n\nExtension: Compare iPhone value chain with coffee value chain:\n\nGrowing (Ethiopia, Colombia, etc.)\nProcessing/roasting (often core countries)\nBranding/retail (Starbucks, etc.)\n\nReport out (10 min): Groups present findings with visual diagrams\nClass synthesis (5 min):\n\nCommon patterns across value chains?\nImplications for development strategy?\nLinks to dependency theory recommendations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Terms of Trade Deterioration\nPrebisch-Singer hypothesis (1950s):\nOver the long run, prices of primary commodities decline relative to manufactures.\nMechanisms:\n\nIncome elasticity: As income rises, proportion spent on food/raw materials falls\nTechnological change: Substitutes for raw materials (synthetics, efficiency gains)\nMarket structure: Competitive primary producers vs. oligopolistic manufacturers\nLabor organization: Stronger unions in manufacturing pass productivity gains to wages;

    "text": "📉 Part 4: Dependency Theory - From Analysis to Policy\n\n4.1 Context and Origins\nLatin American experience (1950s-1970s):\n\nPost-WWII independence, industrialization attempts\nECLA (Economic Commission for Latin America): Structuralist economics\nImport-substitution industrialization (ISI) policies\nGrowing frustration with persistent dependency\nCuban Revolution (1959): Alternative development path?\n\nKey institutions and thinkers:\n\nECLA (Raúl Prebisch, Celso Furtado)\nDependency school (Andre Gunder Frank, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Enzo Faletto)\nAfrican variants (Samir Amin, Walter Rodney)\n\nRelationship to Marxism:\n\nMarxist-influenced but heterogeneous\nSome orthodox Marxist (Frank’s early work)\nSome reformist (Cardoso’s later work)\nShared: Focus on external constraints, power relations, class analysis\n\n\n\n4.2 Core Dependency Arguments\n\n4.2.1 Frank’s “Development of Underdevelopment”\nCentral thesis: Underdevelopment is not original/traditional state but actively produced by capitalism\nArgument:\n\nMetropolis-satellite chains: Extraction of surplus through multiple levels\n\nWorld metropolis (London, New York) extracts from\nNational metropolis (São Paulo, Buenos Aires) which extracts from\nRegional centers which extract from\nRural hinterlands\n\nEven “feudal” relations serve capitalism:\n\nLatin American latifundia (large estates) look feudal\nBut integrated into world market through export\nBackward methods maintained because: (a) Cheap labor maximizes extraction, (b) Elite has no incentive to modernize\n\nSatellite development only when metropolis weakened:\n\nBrazilian industrialization during WWII (metropolis distracted)\nGenerally, tight integration = underdevelopment\nIsolation = better development prospects\n\n\nRadical implication: Must break from world capitalist system to develop\nCriticisms:\n\nOverstates inevitability of underdevelopment\nUnderestimates agency within periphery\nSome countries DID develop while integrated (East Asia)\nNeglects class dynamics within periphery (nation too homogeneous)\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Cardoso & Faletto’s “Associated-Dependent Development”\nMore nuanced position: Development possible but distorted\nKey argument:\nDevelopment can occur in periphery through alliance of:\n\nInternational capital (foreign corporations)\nLocal bourgeoisie (domestic capitalists)\nState (developmental apparatus)\n\nExample: Brazilian “miracle” (1968-1973)\n\nRapid industrial growth (~10% annual GDP growth)\nForeign investment in automotive, electronics\nState investment in infrastructure\nBUT: Extremely unequal, repressive military dictatorship, environmental damage\n\nCharacteristics of associated-dependent development:\n\nExternally-oriented: Production for export or elite consumption\nTechnologically dependent: Foreign technology, patents\nHighly unequal: Benefits concentrated among elites\nAuthoritarian: Requires repression of popular demands\nEcologically destructive: Amazon deforestation for expansion\n\nImplication: Development under these conditions perpetuates dependency and inequality\nDifference from Frank:\n\nFrank: Underdevelopment inevitable within capitalism\nCardoso: Development possible but distorted, dependent\nFrank: Break from system\nCardoso: Reform from within (later became neoliberal president of Brazil - controversial!)\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Amin’s “Autocentric vs. Extraverted” Development\nDistinction:\nAutocentric development (core countries):\n\nInternal market drives accumulation\nConsumption goods sector → Capital goods sector linkages\nWages rise with productivity (mass consumption)\nSelf-sustaining growth\n\nExtraverted development (peripheral countries):\n\nExternal demand (exports) drives accumulation\nLuxury consumption sector → Capital goods imports\nWages disconnected from productivity (surplus extracted/exported)\nDependent on core demand\n\nMechanism of extraversion:\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    A[Export sector&lt;br/&gt;High productivity] --&gt; B[Surplus generated]\n    B --&gt; C[Repatriated profits]\n    B --&gt; D[Luxury

fill:#4a90e2\n    style F fill:#d0021b\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult: No internal dynamic of accumulation\nPolicy implication:\n\nReorient economy toward internal market\nIncome redistribution to create domestic demand\nReduce import dependence\nBuild capital goods sector domestically\n\nExample: South Korea as partial exception\n\nStarted as extraverted (export-oriented)\nBut: Land reform created domestic market\nState directed surplus to strategic industries\nGradual building of capital goods sector\nEventually more autocentric (but still export-dependent)\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Policy Experiments - Import Substitution Industrialization\nLogic of ISI:\n\nProblem: Declining terms of trade, technological dependence\nSolution: Replace imports with domestic production\nMethod: Tariffs, quotas, exchange controls, subsidies\nGoal: Create integrated industrial structure\n\nTypical stages:\n\nEasy ISI: Consumer non-durables (textiles, food processing)\nDifficult ISI: Consumer durables, intermediate goods (steel, chemicals)\nCapital goods ISI: Machinery, technology production\n\nHistorical implementation:\n\nLatin America: 1930s-1970s (forced by Great Depression, WWII)\nIndia: 1950s-1990s (Nehruvian socialism)\nAfrica: 1960s-1980s (post-independence developmentalism)\n\nInitial successes:\n\nIndustrialization: Brazil, Mexico, Argentina built manufacturing sectors\nReduced import dependence for consumer goods\nCreated industrial working class, technical expertise\nHigh growth rates in some periods\n\nProblems emerged (1970s-1980s):\n\nInefficiency: Protected industries lacked competitive pressure\nCapital goods dependence: Still imported machinery, technology\nForeign exchange crises: Need dollars for capital imports but exports declined\nElite capture: Benefits concentrated, subsidies to wealthy industrialists\nDebt crises: Borrowed to finance imports → 1980s debt crisis\nInequality: Urban bias, neglect of agriculture, informal sector\n\nNeoliberal critique (1980s-1990s):\n\nISI “failed” → must liberalize, export, integrate into world economy\nWashington Consensus: Privatize, deregulate, free trade\nIMF structural adjustment programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDependency theorists’ response\n\n\n\n\n\nISI didn’t fail, it was abandoned prematurely:\n\nTakes time: Core countries protected industries for decades (Hamilton, List)\nNeed to continue to capital goods stage: Stopped at intermediate stage\nPolitical economy: Elite opposed land reform, income redistribution needed for internal market\nExternal pressure: Debt crisis used to force liberalization\nEast Asia succeeded with similar policies: But had different political economy (land reform, education, strong state)\n\nDebate continues: Was ISI inherently flawed or badly implemented?\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 The East Asian “Exception”\nPuzzle for dependency theory:\nSouth Korea, Taiwan, Singapore industrialized rapidly while integrated into world economy\nDependency theory predictions seemed wrong:\n\nTight integration should prevent development\nExport-orientation should perpetuate dependency\nForeign investment should extract surplus\n\nWhat actually happened:\n\nRapid industrial upgrading\nTechnological capability development\nRising wages, reduced inequality\nMoved from periphery to core (or near-core)\n\nDependency theorists’ explanations:\n\nCold War geopolitics:\n\nUS support (aid, market access, technology transfer)\nCounterweight to communism\nNot replicable for countries outside Cold War frontline\n\nLand reform:\n\nDestroyed traditional landed elite\nCreated internal market for industrial goods\nContrast: Latin America’s failure to do land reform\n\nStrong developmental state:\n\nNot just free market (contra neoliberal narrative)\nStrategic industrial policy, directed credit\nPerformance requirements for firms\n\nSpecific historical conditions:\n\nJapanese colonial legacy (infrastructure, education)\nExternal security threat (North Korea)\nSmall size (easier to coordinate)\n\n\nContemporary debates:\n\nCan model be replicated?\n\nCold War over, less US support\nChina blocks space for other manufacturing exporters?\nClimate constraints prevent industrial path?\n\nWas it really an exception?\n\nStill dependent on US market, technology\nRecent stagnation (middle-income trap)\nSocial costs (overwork, inequality, environmental)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipInteractive Element 5: ISI vs. EOI Debate (30 minutes)\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup: Class debate on development strategies\nMotion: “Import-substitution industrialization was a failed development strategy that should not be attempted again”\nPreparation (15 min):\nDivide class into four groups:\n\nPRO team (ISI failed): Research neoliberal critiques of ISI\n\nInefficiency, rent-seeking, debt crises\nContrast with East Asian export success\nEvidence from Latin American stagnation 1980s-90s\n\nCON team (ISI not inherently failed): Research dependency theorist defenses\n\nISI abandoned prematurely\nExternal constraints (debt crisis, IMF pressure)\nEast Asia used similar policies (industrial policy)\nAlternative interpretation: Implementation failures, not strategy failure\n\nJudges (Group 3): Develop evaluation criteria\n\nWhat evidence would prove ISI “failed”?\nWhat would prove it “succeeded”?\nHow to account for external context?\n\nModerators (Group 4): Develop questions\n\nHow define “success” or “failure”?\nCounterfactuals: What would have happened without ISI?\nContext: Can we compare across decades, continents?\n\n\nDebate structure (15 min):\n\nOpening statements: PRO (2 min), CON (2 min)\nRebuttals: PRO (2 min), CON (2 min)\nQuestions from moderators: (4 min)\nClosing statements: PRO (1 min), CON (1 min)\nJudges’ verdict with reasoning: (4 min)\n\nKey learning:\n\nDependency theory challenges simple “success/failure” narratives\nContext matters: Political economy, geopolitics, timing\nDevelopment strategies are political choices with winners/losers\nNo consensus among scholars - legitimate debate continues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Delinking Debates\nRadical dependency position (Amin, Frank’s early work):\nMust “delink” from world capitalist system to develop autonomously\nArguments for delinking:\n\nImpossible to develop within system: Core-periphery structure prevents it\nNeed autonomous development: Define own priorities, not dictated by world market\nSouth-South cooperation: Trade among peripheral countries\nSocialist alternative: Plan economy for needs, not profits\n\nArguments against delinking:\n\nOpportunity costs: Miss benefits of trade, technology access\nScale: Many countries too small for autonomous development\nPower: Core countries can blockade, sanction, destabilize\nHistorical evidence: Socialist experiments faced severe problems (Cuba, Tanzania)\n\nHistorical experiments:\n\nTanzania (Ujamaa): Self-reliance, rural socialism, pan-Africanism\n\nInitial enthusiasm, some social gains (literacy, health)\nEconomic stagnation, external pressure, abandoned 1980s\n\nCuba: Survived through Soviet support, resilience after 1991\n\nSocial achievements (health, education)\nEconomic difficulties, embargo effects debated\n\nNicaragua (Sandinistas): Attempted autonomous development\n\nExternal destabilization (Contra war, US economic warfare)\nDefeated electorally after economic crisis\n\n\nContemporary forms:\n\nNot complete delinking but selective disengagement\nSouth-South trade (BRICS, regional integration)\nProtection of strategic sectors\nCapital controls, industrial policy\n“Alter-globalization” not anti-globalization"

Harvey: Property rights about power, who has rights to exclude whom?\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Global Value Chains\nNew international division of labor:\n\nProduction fragmented across countries\nEach stage in different location (labor costs, regulations, skills)\nCoordinated by lead firms (Apple, Nike, H&M)\n“Smile curve”: Value concentrated at design and retail ends\n\nExample: Garment industry\n\nDesign: New York, Milan, Paris (high value-added)\nFabric: Turkey, China, South Korea (medium)\nSewing: Bangladesh, Vietnam, Cambodia (low value-added)\nRetail: Brand capture (H&M, Zara)\n\nRana Plaza collapse (Bangladesh, 2013):\n\nFactory building collapsed, 1,134 workers killed\nProducing for Western brands\nHighlights: Low wages, unsafe conditions, limited upgrading opportunities\nSupply chain pressures drive down costs → safety corners cut\n\nValue chain analysis:\n\nWho captures value at each node?\nPower relations between lead firms and suppliers\nBarriers to upgrading (lead firms’ strategic control)\nRace to bottom in labor standards?\n\nDependency theory lens:\n\nUpdated form of unequal exchange\nPeriphery: Low value-added activities (assembly)\nCore: High value-added activities (design, branding, technology)\nUpgrading difficult: Lead firms control access to consumers, technology\n\nContrast with mainstream GVC literature:\n\nMainstream: GVCs as opportunity for development (participation → upgrading)\nDependency: GVCs as mechanism of extraction (value captured by core lead firms)\nDifferent policy implications: Join GVCs vs. develop autonomous capabilities\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Technology and Premature Deindustrialization\nRodrik’s puzzle (2016): Developing countries deindustrializing at lower income levels than historical developers\nMechanism:\n\nAutomation, AI, robotics reduce labor content of manufacturing\nManufacturing employment peaks earlier in development process\n“Premature deindustrialization”\n\nExample:\n\nBritain: Peaked at 35% manufacturing employment (1960s), $14,000 GDP per capita\nBrazil: Peaked at 15% manufacturing employment (1980s), $10,000 GDP per capita\nIndia: May peak at &lt;10% manufacturing, even lower GDP per capita\n\nImplications for development:\n\nTraditional “manufacturing-led development” path closing?\nServices can substitute? (Debate: Productivity growth lower in services)\nEast Asian model unreplicable?\n\nTechnology dependence reinforced:\n\nAI, robotics developed in core countries\nOwnership (patents), skills (training) concentrated in core\nPeriphery: Technology consumers, dependent on core innovation\n\nMarxist analysis:\n\nTechnological change is not neutral (Session 4 assumption)\nServes capital accumulation in core\nDestroys employment opportunities in periphery\nReinforces global hierarchy\n\nPolicy debates:\n\nShould periphery try to leapfrog? (Services, technology sectors)\nOr protect manufacturing despite efficiency losses?\nIndustrial policy for technology generation, not just adoption?\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Financialization of Development\nNeoliberal era (1980s-present):\n\nTrade liberalization, capital account opening\nFinancial flows dwarf real economy flows\nDebt as development constraint\n\nMechanisms of control:\n\nDebt crises:\n\nLatin America (1980s), Asia (1997), Argentina (2001), Greece (2010s)\nIMF structural adjustment: Austerity, privatization, liberalization\nDebt service &gt; development spending\n\nCapital flows volatility:\n\nHot money flows in → Asset bubbles, exchange rate appreciation\nSudden stops/reversals → Crisis, capital flight\nPeripheral countries’ policy autonomy constrained\n\nOffshore financial centers:\n\nCapital flight from periphery to tax havens\nEstimated trillions hidden offshore\nReduces tax base, development resources\n\n\nExample: Argentina’s crisis (2001)\n\nConvertibility plan (1991): Peso pegged to dollar\nForeign investment flows in → Growth, privatization\nDebt accumulates, exports uncompetitive\n2001: Default, social explosion\nIMF conditions: Austerity perpetuates crisis\n\nContemporary examples:\n\nAfrican debt (2010s-2020s): Chinese lending, commodity price collapse\nLebanon (2019-2020): Financial collapse, currency crisis\nSri Lanka (2022): Debt default, political crisis\n\nDependency theory lens:\n\nFinance as tool of core dominance\nDebt as disciplining mechanism (prevents autonomous policy)\n“Debt trap diplomacy” debates (China’s BRI)\n\nAlternative proposals:\n\nDebt jubilee movements\nCapital controls (Tobin tax, transaction taxes)\nSouth-South financial institutions (BRICS bank)\nCryptocurrency?

Whose interests?\nClass and capability deprivation: Exploitation as systematic capability denial\n\nExample: Garment workers’ capabilities\n\nSen would focus: Literacy, health, political voice\nMarx would add: Control over labor process, surplus appropriation, collective organization\nBoth relevant: Multidimensional framework including power relations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWith Institutional Economics (Session 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Institutional Economics (OIE) - Close Affinities\nShared theoretical commitments:\n\nPower and conflict: Both reject harmonious equilibrium; institutions embody power relations\nEvolutionary analysis: Historical, processual understanding (not equilibrium states)\nMethodological holism: Skeptical of methodological individualism; social structures matter\nSocial embeddedness: Economic activity embedded in social relations\nCritique of mainstream: Both challenge neoclassical assumptions\n\nHistorical connections:\n\nVeblen influenced by Marx’s historical materialism\nCommons engaged with class conflict (labor relations research)\nBoth traditions marginalized in Cold War era economics\nPartial revival in heterodox economics today\n\nKey convergences for development:\n\nCumulative causation (Myrdal): Development/underdevelopment self-reinforcing\n\nSimilar to dependency theory’s vicious circles\nNo automatic convergence mechanism\n\nCeremonial vs. instrumental institutions (Veblen, Bush):\n\nCeremonial: Serve status, power, invidious distinctions\nInstrumental: Serve life process, technological efficiency\nParallel to Marx: Institutions serve accumulation vs. human needs\n\nInstitutional change: Both see change through conflict, power struggles\n\nOIE: Between ceremonial and instrumental\nMarxism: Between classes\n\n\n\n\nVeblen’s Critique of Marx\nDespite affinities, Veblen offered important criticisms that highlight differences:\n1. Teleology and Historical Inevitability\n\nVeblen’s critique: Marx assumes capitalism will inevitably collapse, socialism will emerge\nProblem: Historical materialism becomes deterministic, denies human agency\nVeblen’s alternative: Evolutionary change is open-ended, not predetermined\nContemporary relevance: Capitalism has proven more adaptable than Marx expected\n\n2. Labor Theory of Value\n\nVeblen’s critique: Labor theory of value is metaphysical, not scientific\nProblem: Value not reducible to labor time; institutional context matters\nVeblen’s alternative: Value is socially constructed through institutions\nFor development: Both can agree exploitation exists without needing labor theory\n\n3. Class Reductionism\n\nVeblen’s critique: Marx reduces all conflicts to class struggle\nProblem: Other dimensions (gender, race, nationalism) also matter\nVeblen’s emphasis: Multiple status hierarchies, conspicuous consumption\nContemporary relevance: Intersectionality debates; identity politics\n\n4. Industrial vs. Pecuniary Employment\n\nVeblen’s distinction:\n\nIndustrial: Making goods (engineers, workers)\nPecuniary: Making money (financiers, absentee owners)\n\nContrast with Marx: Not capital vs. labor but makers vs. takers\nFor development: Both traditions critique financialization, but different frameworks\n\n5. Technological Determinism\n\nVeblen: Technology shapes institutions (“machine process”)\nMarx: Technology is not neutral; shaped by class relations\nDebate continues: Is technology driving force or shaped by social relations?\n\n\n\nSynthesis for Development Theory\nWhat OIE adds to Marxism:\n\nInstitutional variety: Not all capitalist institutions identical\nCultural factors: “Habits of thought” shape economic behavior\nNon-class dimensions: Gender, race, status hierarchies\nReform possibilities: Institutional change without revolution\n\nWhat Marxism adds to OIE:\n\nSystematic theory: Coherent analysis of capitalist dynamics\nGlobal perspective: Imperialism, world-system analysis\nClass power: Central mechanism of exploitation, inequality\nTransformative vision: Alternative to capitalism specified\n\nImplications for development policy:\n\nOIE emphasizes: Institutional reform, ceremonial/instrumental distinction\nMarxism emphasizes: Power structures, systemic transformation\nBoth useful: Complementary lenses on development challenges\nContemporary heterodox economics: Often combines insights from both\n\n\n\nNew Institutional Economics (NIE) contrasts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDimension\nNIE (Acemoglu et al.)\nMarxist/Dependency\n\n\n\n\nInstitutions\nReduce transaction costs\nEmbody class power\n\n\nDevelopment\nUniversal path with good institutions\nContext-dependent, relational\n\n\nProperty rights\nNeutral efficiency\nWhose property?

To extract! (Tautology?)\nDependency addition: Post-colonial extractive institutions perpetuate extraction for global capital\nKey difference: NIE sees institutions as primary cause; Marxism sees institutions as expression of class/imperial power\n\nExample: Botswana “success story”\n\nNIE: Good institutions (property rights, democracy) → diamonds managed well → development\nDependency critique:\n\nGood institutions for whom?

Who are the actors?\nApply dependency theory concepts:\n\nWhich mechanisms of uneven development are visible?\nWho benefits? Who loses?\nWhat power relations structure the case?\n\nCompare with mainstream (NIE) explanation:\n\nHow would Acemoglu et al. explain this?\nWhat does dependency theory reveal that NIE misses?\n\nPolicy implications:\n\nWhat would dependency theory recommend?\nWhat obstacles to such policies?\nHistorical parallels?\n\n\n\n\nEssay Questions (Optional Practice)\n\n“Dependency theory predicted that countries integrated into the global economy would remain underdeveloped. The success of East Asian NICs proves dependency theory wrong.” Discuss. (1000 words)\nHint: Define “success,” consider historical context, evaluate whether East Asia is exception or confirms modified dependency theory\n“New Institutional Economics (Acemoglu et al.) and Marxist development theory both emphasize institutions but offer fundamentally different explanations for underdevelopment. Compare and evaluate these perspectives.” (1000 words)\nHint: Core concepts of each, what questions each asks, empirical evidence, normative implications\n“Import-substitution industrialization failed in Latin America but similar policies succeeded in East Asia. What explains this difference?” (1000 words)\nHint: Define failure/success, compare political economy (land reform, state capacity, class structure), external context (Cold War), implementation details\n“Contemporary global value chains represent an updated form of the core-periphery hierarchy described by dependency theory.” Assess this claim. (1000 words)\nHint: Define GVCs and core-periphery, apply unequal exchange concepts, use empirical examples, consider counter-arguments\n\n\n\nIn-Class Debate Topics\n\n“The global economy is structured to benefit core countries at the expense of peripheral countries.”\n“Marxist development theory is no longer relevant after the collapse of the Soviet Union and China’s market reforms.”\n“Developing countries should delink from the global economy to achieve autonomous development.”"

Unequal value capture\n\nChile: Extraction creates minimal value for locals; most captured by foreign capital and core manufacturers\nVietnam: Assembly creates minimal value; most captured by brands and IP holders\nKenya: Digital labor creates minimal value for workers; most captured by platform monopolies\nPattern: Periphery creates value through labor and resources; core captures value through ownership, technology, brands\n\n\n\n2. Technology monopolies enforce hierarchy\n\nChile: Battery technology monopolized by core; Chile cannot move into manufacturing\nVietnam: IP protections prevent Vietnam from developing design capabilities\nKenya: Platform algorithms and AI monopolized; Kenya cannot develop alternatives\nPattern: Technological control is the mechanism that maintains core-periphery hierarchy in the 21st century\n\n\n\n3. Race to the bottom / capital mobility threat\n\nChile: Must compete with other extractors; environmental standards suppressed\nVietnam: Must compete with China, Bangladesh; labor costs suppressed\nKenya: Must compete with India, Philippines; wages and conditions suppressed\nPattern: Peripheral countries compete against each other for capital; core capital plays them off against each other\n\n\n\n4. Environmental/social costs externalized to periphery\n\nChile: Water depletion, environmental destruction remain local\nVietnam: Pollution from electronics manufacturing\nKenya: Psychological trauma and PTSD from content moderation\nPattern: Core benefits (EVs, phones, “clean” platforms); periphery bears costs\n\n\n\n5. GDP growth without development\n\nChile: Lithium sector grows; communities impoverished\nVietnam: 6-7% GDP growth; workers can’t afford products\nKenya: Digital economy expands; workers precarious and traumatized\nPattern: Integration into global capitalism creates growth statistics but not genuine development\n\n\n\n6. Dependency locks in underdevelopment\n\nChile: More lithium extracted = more locked into raw material export\nVietnam: More electronics assembled = more locked into subordinate manufacturing\nKenya: More platform labor = more locked into digital periphery status\nPattern: “Success” in current role makes escaping that role harder - path dependence\n\n\n\n7. Labor surplus extraction intensified\n\nChile: Workers paid fraction of value created\nVietnam: Workers paid $200-400/month to create products worth thousands\nKenya: Workers paid $1.50-2.50/hour while platforms valued at billions\nPattern: Global capitalism enables extreme surplus extraction - workers receive tiny fraction of value they create\n\n\n\n8. Ownership/control by foreign capital\n\nChile: Foreign investors control SQM; profits repatriated\nVietnam: Samsung, Apple, Intel own production; Vietnamese are employees\nKenya: Meta, Uber, Scale AI own platforms; Kenyans are precarious contractors\nPattern: Peripheral economies controlled by core capital; sovereignty compromised\n\nWhat this suggests about global economy structure:\nThe global economy is not a level playing field moving toward convergence, but a hierarchical system that systematically channels value from periphery to core through:\n\nTechnological monopolies (patents, platforms, algorithms)\nOwnership structures (foreign capital control)\nUnequal exchange (wage differentials, monopoly power)\nEnvironmental externalization (costs in periphery, benefits in core)\nCompetition among peripheral countries (race to bottom)\nPath dependencies (integration locks in subordination)\n\nThese are not “market failures” but the normal functioning of global capitalism.

    "text": "Question 3: Development Strategies\n\nAnalysis of Three Approaches:\n\n1. Radical Break (Frank): Complete delinking from capitalist world system\nWhat this would mean for our cases: - Chile: Nationalize lithium completely; refuse to export to core; develop domestic battery/EV industry behind protective barriers; might mean autarky and isolation - Vietnam: Expropriate foreign factories; develop autonomous electronics industry; exit global value chains; accept technological gap temporarily - Kenya: Ban foreign platforms; develop domestic platform cooperatives; accept losing access to global digital economy\nFeasibility: Low\n\nRequires revolutionary transformation of political-economic system\nFaces massive external pressure (sanctions, capital flight, credit cutoff)\nDifficult to develop technology in isolation from global knowledge networks\nFew successful examples (Cuba survived but with great difficulty; Soviet model collapsed)\n\nDesirability: Debatable\n\nWould escape immediate exploitation\nBut might face technological isolation and stagnation\nCould lead to authoritarian politics (centralized control needed to resist external pressure)\nMight impoverish population in short-term (loss of export revenues, technology access)\n\nHistorical lesson: Few countries successfully pursued complete delinking. Those that tried (Soviet bloc, Maoist China, Cuba) faced enormous costs and many eventually reintegrated on unfavorable terms.\n\n\n\n2. Selective Delinking (Amin): Reduce dependence, reorient to internal markets\nWhat this would mean for our cases:\n\nChile: Maintain lithium exports but capture more value (taxation, processing locally); use revenues for diversified industrialization; develop internal market and regional trade (Latin American integration)\nVietnam: Maintain electronics manufacturing but push for technology transfer; simultaneously develop domestic electronics brands and internal consumer market; reduce export-dependence gradually\nKenya: Allow platforms but regulate heavily (employment status, minimum wages, data rights); simultaneously develop domestic digital economy for local needs (healthcare, education, agriculture)\n\nFeasibility: Medium\n\nMore realistic than complete delinking\nStill faces capital mobility threats and external pressure\nRequires strong state capacity and political will\nExamples: Some success in East Asian tigers (Korea, Taiwan) though under specific Cold War conditions\n\nDesirability: High\n\nBalances integration with autonomy\nAllows gradual transition rather than shock\nMaintains access to technology and markets while building alternatives\nCould improve conditions without revolutionary disruption\n\nChallenges:\n\nCapital mobility means regulation can trigger capital flight\nWTO/trade agreements constrain industrial policy options\nRequires political coalition capable of resisting both foreign pressure and domestic comprador elites\nTiming matters: Global context more hostile now than during Asian Tigers’ rise\n\n\n\n\n3. Pragmatic Reform (ECLA/CEPAL): Strategic state intervention and industrial policy\nWhat this would mean for our cases:\n\nChile: Keep extractive industries but tax heavily; use revenues for education, infrastructure, R&D; industrial policy to develop battery/EV manufacturing; maintain integration but pursue upgrading\nVietnam: Accept current role but negotiate for technology transfer; invest heavily in education/R&D; use industrial policy to move up value chain gradually (from assembly to design)\nKenya: Regulate platforms moderately (don’t drive them away completely); use digital economy as training ground; invest in tech education; gradually develop domestic digital industry\n\nFeasibility: Medium-High\n\nMost politically feasible (doesn’t threaten capitalism fundamentally)\nLeast likely to trigger extreme external pressure\nHas some successful examples (South Korea, Taiwan, now China)\n\nDesirability: Medium\n\nBetter than unregulated integration\nBut may not fundamentally transform core-periphery relations\nRisk of cosmetic reforms that maintain underlying exploitation\nEffectiveness depends heavily on global context\n\nChallenges:\n\nCapital mobility limits how much states can regulate\nGlobal institutions (WTO, IMF) constrain policy space more now than during ISI era\nRequires competent developmental state (not all states have this capacity)\nMay perpetuate some exploitation even while improving conditions\nSuccess of Asian Tigers had specific Cold War context (US support) unlikely to repeat\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Assessment:\nMost feasible: Pragmatic reform (ECLA approach)\n\nLeast likely to trigger complete capital flight or external destruction\nCan build political coalitions (even some capitalists benefit)\nSome proven track record of success\n\nMost desirable: Selective delinking (Amin)\n\nBalances autonomy with integration\nAddresses structural dependency without revolutionary rupture\nAllows experimentation and learning\nCould build toward more radical transformation if successful\n\nLeast feasible but potentially most transformative: Radical break (Frank)\n\nOnly complete solution to exploitation under capitalism\nBut extremely difficult to achieve and sustain\nHigh short-term costs\nRisk of authoritarian degeneration\n\nSynthesis possibility: Progressive strategy\n\nStart with pragmatic reforms (build state capacity, tax resources, develop human capital)\nGradually move toward selective delinking (reduce dependence, strengthen internal markets, regional integration)\nCreate conditions where more radical transformation becomes possible if desired\n\nKey insight: The strategy must match both the objective structural conditions AND the subjective political conditions (organized social forces, consciousness, state capacity).\nA radical strategy without adequate subjective conditions will fail (invite repression, capital flight, isolation). But purely pragmatic reform without building toward structural transformation may only manage exploitation rather than overcome it.\nCurrent global context considerations:\n\nRise of China offers alternative development model and potential partner\nClimate crisis makes some forms of “development” unsustainable\nDigital technology could enable new forms of coordination/ownership (platform cooperatives, etc.)\nBut also: Neoliberal globalization has constrained policy space dramatically\nAnd: Technology monopolies stronger than ever (FAANG, etc.)\n\nNo easy answers: each strategy involves tradeoffs, risks, and contextual dependencies. The “best” strategy depends on specific country context, global conditions, and political possibilities."

    "text": "How do we know if a country is “developing”? This seemingly simple question has sparked decades of debate among economists, policymakers, and development practitioners. The answer you get depends entirely on how you measure development – and as you’ll discover in this guide, there are many ways to do so.\nJust as a simple example, consider these three scenarios:\n\nCountry A has doubled its GDP per capita over the past decade, but income inequality has also increased dramatically\nCountry B has modest economic growth but has achieved universal primary education and dramatically reduced infant mortality\nCountry C exports sophisticated technology products but relies heavily on imported food and has frequent power outages\n\nWhich country is developing most successfully? The answer depends on what you think development means and how you choose to measure it. Development indicators can be both exciting and frustrating. On the one hand, they force people to be explicit about what they mean by “development.” On the other hand, however, in practice, people who use development indicators often don’t think about the big ideas and normative commitments behind these numbers. After reading this short introduction to the most common development indicators, you should be ready to do better.\n\n\nDevelopment measurement isn’t just an academic exercise. The indicators discussed below shape how real-world decisions are being made:\n\nInternational aid allocation often depends on GDP per capita and poverty headcount ratios\nInvestment flows are influenced by economic complexity and governance indicators\n\nPolicy priorities shift based on whether countries focus on economic growth, human development, or inequality reduction\nAcademic research and policy recommendations depend heavily on how we define and measure development success\n\n\n\n\nThis guide introduces you to the most important quantitative measures used in development economics today. Rather than advocating for any single approach, we’ll explore multiple perspectives – from traditional economic indicators to alternative measures that challenge conventional thinking.\nThroughout this guide, we maintain a pluralist perspective that recognizes legitimate disagreement about how to measure development. Whether you’re drawn to neoclassical growth theory, capabilities approaches, or structuralist critiques, you’ll need to understand how different schools of thought measure progress toward their vision of development.\nAs you’ll see, there is no “perfect” development indicator. Each measure captures something important while missing something else. The goal isn’t to find the one true measure, but to build your analytical toolkit so you can choose the right tools for your research questions – and understand the implications of those choices."

    "title": "1: Important measures of development",
    "section": "2.1 Gross Domestic Product (GDP)",
    "text": "2.1 Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\nGDP is probably not only the most widely used measure for development, but also the one that received the most critiques. The main reason is that while GDP was developed as a measure for the total income in an economy, it is often used - implicitly or explicitly - as a measure for wellbeing. Something it has not been designed for in the first place. But we come back to this debate later on, here is is mainly about what GDP is in the first place. If you are looking for a slightly more complete, but still very accessible introduction, read chapter 24 of Mankiw (2024).\nDefinition & Calculation:\nA common definition of GDP is “the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period” (Mankiw 2024: 24).1 GDP aggregates many different goods and services by using their market value as a common unit - for example, it adds together cars, haircuts, and smartphones by using their prices.\nWhile this allows straightforward aggregation, it comes with drawbacks: GDP excludes most goods for which no market value is available (or uses only approximate estimations of their hypothetical market value), such as goods produced for subsistence or household consumption.\nAlso note that GDP focuses on final demand, so it does not include intermediate goods (like steel sold to car manufacturers). It also focuses on produced goods, so sales of new cars are included while sales of used cars are not.\nAn important distinction in practice is that of Real vs. Nominal GDP: Nominal GDP measures output at current market prices, while real GDP adjusts for inflation by using constant prices from a base year. For instance, if we look at the GDP for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012, nominal GDP would be calculated using the respective prices of each year. For the real GDP we need to set a base year. Assume we set 2010 as this base year. Then we compute the GDP for 2011 and 2012 using the prices from 2010 for all three years. Real GDP enables meaningful comparisons over time by removing the effect of price changes. For example, if nominal GDP doubles but all prices also double, real GDP remains unchanged - the economy has not actually grown, but only prices have.\nAnother important correction in the context of development is that of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjustment: PPP corrects for price level differences between countries, enabling better comparisons across nations. This is important because the same basket of goods might cost very different amounts of money in different countries: 1,000 USD, for instance, buys more goods in India than in Norway, simply because the price level in India is much lower than in Norway. PPP adjustments convert all countries’ GDP to a common currency (usually so called international dollars) based on what the money can actually buy domestically, rather than using market exchange rates.\nCommon Data Sources:\n\nWorld Bank World Development Indicators (WDI):\n\nNY.GDP.PCAP.CD (current US$)\nNY.GDP.PCAP.KD (constant 2015 US$)\nNY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD (PPP current international $)\n\nIMF World Economic Outlook Database: GDP per capita, current prices & PPP\nPenn World Table 10.01: rgdpe (expenditure-side real GDP), rgdpo (output-side real GDP), rgdpna (national accounts).\n\nThe expenditure-side measures GDP from spending (consumption + investment + government + net exports), while output-side measures from production value-added.\n\n\nWhat it captures and other advantages:\n\nMarket value of final goods and services, i.e. overall productive strength\nIt correlates with many more fundamental welfare measures\nStandardized methodology across countries through the UN System of National Accounts\nLong time series available (back to 1960s for most countries)\nHigh frequency updates (annual, some quarterly)\n\nWhat it omits and other disadvantages:\n\nIt has not been designed as a measure for well-being\nCorrelation with fundamental welfare measures does not imply causality\nDoes not consider the informal economy, unpaid work, subsistence production and non-market activities (significant in developing countries)\nIgnores aspects, such as income distribution, or environmental costs and resource depletion\nMarket prices may not reflect social value"

See Figure 1 and Table 1. As you can see the two are usually very similar. The larger differences for some countries point to some important structural features:\n\nFor the Philippines, GNI is much higher than GDP. This is because of the large diaspora experienced by the country, with many residences working abroad and sending remittances to their families. The resulting net primary income from abroad increases GNI above GDP.\nFor Qatar, the fact that GDP is larger than GNI points to relatively large net outflows of income to foreign residents and companies. This is due to the large share of foreign workers and foreign-owned companies in the country, resulting in substantial outflows of income as remittances and profit repatriation. As a result, net primary income from abroad is negative, making GNI lower than GDP.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Clean and reshape data\ndata_clean &lt;- data_gdp_gni |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(GDPpc) & !is.na(GNIpc)) |&gt; \n  summarise(across(\n    .cols = all_of(c(\"GDPpc\", \"GNIpc\")), \n    .fns = mean), \n    .by = \"country\") |&gt; \n  mutate(difference = GNIpc - GDPpc,\n         difference_pct = (difference/GDPpc)*100)\n\n# Visualize GDP vs GNI\nggplot(data_clean, aes(x = GDPpc, y = GNIpc, color = country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\") +\n  geom_label_repel(aes(label=country)) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"H\") + \n  labs(title = \"GDP vs GNI per capita (PPP)\",\n       x = \"GDP per capita (PPP, current international $)\",\n       y = \"GNI per capita (PPP, current international $)\",\n       caption = \"Dashed line: GDP = GNI\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n# Show countries with largest differences\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: GNI and GDP for some selected countries.

    "text": "3.2 Gender Development Index (GDI) & Gender Inequality Index (GII)\nDefinition & Calculation:\nInequality across gender has received more and more attention in development economics. One straightforward mearues for differences between living conditions across gender is the GDI. It measures gender gaps in human development by calculating separate HDI values for women and men, then taking their ratio. A GDI value of 1 indicates perfect equality.\nThe GII takes a slightly different approach and considers different dimensions than the classical HDI, all more focused on measuring the living conditions of females. It takes into account three dimensions:\n\nreproductive health (maternal mortality, adolescent birth rates)\nempowerment (parliamentary representation, secondary education)\neconomic status (labor force participation).\n\nHigher values of the GII indicate greater inequality.\nData Sources:\n\nUNDP Human Development Reports\nUN Women, WHO, ILO for component indicators\n\nWhat they capture and other advantages:\n\nHighlight gender disparities often hidden in more traditional aggregate measures\nCover multiple dimensions of gender inequality\nEnable tracking progress on gender equality\n\nWhat they omit and other disadvantages:\n\nLimited by data availability, especially for developing countries\nSome indicators may not capture full extent of gender inequality\nCultural and contextual factors make it difficult to standardize across countries"

    "text": "4.1 Gini Coefficient\nDefinition & Calculation:\nThe Gini coefficient is the most widely used measure of income (or wealth) inequality. It ranges from 0 (perfect equality, where everyone has the same income) to 1 (perfect inequality, where one person has all the income). It is often expressed as a percentage (0-100%).\nThe Gini coefficient is derived from the Lorenz curve. You get the Lorenz curve if you plot the cumulative percentage of total income received on the y axis, and the cumulative percentage of the population (ranked from poorest to richest) on the x axis. In a perfectly equal society, where each person has exactly the same income, the two percentages are always equal and the Lorenz curve is actually a straight 45 degree line. If there is at least a little inequality, the curve emerging from connecting the actual observations diverges from the straight line. This is visualized for two examples in Figure 4. The Gini coefficient is then defined as the area between the Lorenz curve and the line of perfect equality, divided by the total area under the line of perfect equality.

For populat contributions to this debate see, e.g., (Hickel 2019) or (Smith 2021), and for more academic examples (Sullivan and Hickel 2023) and the response in (Rutar 2024).\n\n\nPackages and data used\nhere::i_am(\"content/tutorials/MeasuringDevelopment/index.qmd\")\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\npoverty_data &lt;- read_csv(\n  file = here(\"content/tutorials/MeasuringDevelopment/OWID-poverty-thresholds.csv\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  select(-ends_with(\"annotations\")) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"Number of\")) |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(name=str_remove(name, \" - Income or consumption consolidated\")) |&gt; \n  summarise(Total=sum(value, na.rm = TRUE), .by = c(\"Year\", \"name\")) |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    TotalPop=sum(Total), .by = c(\"Year\"),\n    Share=Total/TotalPop)\n\n# Clean the category names for better visualization\npoverty_data_clean &lt;- poverty_data %&gt;%\n  filter(Year &gt;= 1991) %&gt;%  # Filter data from 1991 onwards\n  mutate(\n    Category = case_when(\n      grepl(\"not in poverty\", name) ~ \"Not in poverty (&gt;$10)\",\n      grepl(\"between \\\\$8.30 and \\\\$10\", name) ~ \"Moderate poverty ($8.30-$10)\",\n      grepl(\"between \\\\$4.20 and \\\\$8.30\", name) ~ \"Poverty ($4.20-$8.30)\",\n      grepl(\"between \\\\$3 and \\\\$4.20\", name) ~ \"Severe poverty ($3-$4.20)\",\n      grepl(\"\\\\$3 a day\", name) ~ \"Extreme poverty (&lt;$3)\",\n      TRUE ~ name\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  # Reorder categories for reverse stacking below (extreme poverty at bottom)\n  mutate(\n    Category = factor(Category, levels = c(\n      \"Not in poverty (&gt;$10)\",\n      \"Moderate poverty ($8.30-$10)\", \n      \"Poverty ($4.20-$8.30)\",\n      \"Severe poverty ($3-$4.20)\",\n      \"Extreme poverty (&lt;$3)\"\n    ))\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Define colors \ncolors &lt;- c(\n  \"Extreme poverty (&lt;$3)\" = \"#8B0000\",     \n  \"Severe poverty ($3-$4.20)\" = \"#CD5C5C\",\n  \"Poverty ($4.20-$8.30)\" = \"#F4A460\",\n  \"Moderate poverty ($8.30-$10)\" = \"#FFD700\", \n  \"Not in poverty (&gt;$10)\" = \"#228B22\"\n)\n\n# Chart 1: Absolute values\nchart1 &lt;- ggplot(poverty_data_clean, aes(x = Year, y = Total/1e9, fill = Category)) +\n  geom_area(alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(poverty_data_clean$Year), \n                                  max(poverty_data_clean$Year), by = 4)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format(suffix = \"B\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Absolute numbers (billions of people)\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Population (Billions)\",\n    fill = \"Income Category\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 9),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)\n  ) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE))\n\n# Chart 2: Relative shares \nchart2 &lt;- ggplot(poverty_data_clean, aes(x = Year, y = Share, fill = Category)) +\n  geom_area(alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(poverty_data_clean$Year), \n                                  max(poverty_data_clean$Year), by = 4)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Relative proportions\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Share of Global Population (%)\",\n    fill = \"Income Category\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 9),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)\n  ) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE))\n\n# Combine both charts using ggarrange\ncombined_plot &lt;- ggarrange(\n  chart1, chart2,\n  ncol = 2, nrow = 1,\n  common.legend = TRUE,\n  legend = \"bottom\"\n)\n\n# Add a common title to the combined plot\nannotated_plot &lt;- annotate_figure(\n  combined_plot,\n  top = text_grob(\"Global Poverty Trends\", \n                  color = \"black\", face = \"bold\", size = 16)\n)\n\nprint(annotated_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The dynamics of absolute numbers and shares of people living in poverty, as defined by different poverty thresholds.

By this one refers to the technological capabilities accumulated by the economic actors in this economy. The underlying idea is that these capabilities are an important driver, not only for growth, but for development more generally.4\nA related concept is that of the product space. This is a network of products, where links between products represent the similarity in capabilities required for their production. The network shows that certain products require only a few capabilities - the products located in the periphery of the space - and other require a lot of capabilities - the products in the core. The latter are those that can only be produced by countries that have a very complex economy. This way it is a strong argument for the relevance of technological capabilities for economic development.5\nData Sources:\n\nAtlas of Economic Complexity (Harvard Growth Lab)\nObservatory of Economic Complexity (OEC)\n\nWhat it captures and other advantages:\n\nCaptures productive capabilities not measured by GDP or other traditional indicators\nStrong predictor of future economic growth and development\nIdentifies opportunities for economic diversification\nAvailable for most countries over long time series\n\nWhat it omits and other disadvantages:\n\nFocuses on exported goods\nMay not capture all forms of economic sophistication (especially in service economies)\nRequires detailed, high-quality trade data (may exclude informal trade)\nComplex methodology can be difficult to interpret for policy purposes\nPotential bias toward manufacturing over other forms of economic activity (“there are other ways to develop”)"

The estimated curve is the result of a quadratic regression model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8 shows that there is a negative, non-linear relationship between total income, as measured by GDP per capita, and the literacy gap. Richer countries tend to have a smaller literature gap, but the data does not tell us whether (a) countries are rich because of smaller gender inequality, or (b) gender inequality is easier to reduce in wealthy countries. The simple regression might also suffer from important variables being omitted. So you would need more sophisticated analysis tools to answer this important question about causality. Still, the observation as such is already interesting.\n\n\nIdentify interesting outliers\nhigh_income_gaps &lt;- gender_data %&gt;%\n  filter(GDPpc &gt; 14000, literacy_gap &gt; 5) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(literacy_gap)) %&gt;%\n  select(country, GDPpc, LiteracyRate_male, LiteracyRate_female, literacy_gap)\n\nlow_income_parity &lt;- gender_data %&gt;%\n  filter(GDPpc &lt; 5000, abs(literacy_gap) &lt; 2) %&gt;%\n  arrange(GDPpc) %&gt;%\n  select(country, GDPpc, LiteracyRate_male, LiteracyRate_female, literacy_gap)\n\nnegative_gaps &lt;- gender_data %&gt;%\n  filter(literacy_gap &lt; 0, abs(literacy_gap) &gt; 2) %&gt;%\n  arrange(GDPpc) %&gt;%\n  select(country, GDPpc, LiteracyRate_male, LiteracyRate_female, literacy_gap)\n\n\nInteresting is, however, not only the relationship, but also the outlier countries, that do not align well with the predicted relationship. For instance, there are some countries with very high literacy gaps despite being rather rich: Egypt and Iran are such examples. One explanation could be that both countries have acquired their wealth because of the export of particular resources, which do not require a very educated population. But again, further investigation would be necessary to reveal the true reasons.\nSimilarly, there are some countries with very low literacy gaps, despite being rather poor. The most notable example is Vanuatu, an island nation in the South Pacific made up of over 80 volcanic islands. The country has one of the region’s lowest gender literacy gaps because policies and community efforts have helped ensure that both boys and girls have nearly equal access to primary schooling, resulting in similar literacy rates for men and women despite a very traditional culture and strong gender inequalities in other areas of life.\nFinally, Lesotho is an interesting case as it has a highly negative literacy gap with women being far more literate than men. Lesotho’s negative gender literacy gap results mainly from male labor migration reducing boys’ school attendance, higher dropout rates among boys due to cultural and economic factors, as well as strong policy emphasis on female education, which has led to very high female literacy rates."

    "text": "Key Takeaways for Your Studies\nThere is no “perfect” development indicator. Each measure we’ve explored - from GDP to HDI to inequality indices - was designed for specific purposes and captures different aspects of development. This isn’t a weakness; it just means that you need different tools analytical toolkit and you need to learn how to use them together.\nThink like a researcher: Before diving into data, always ask yourself: What exactly am I trying to understand? Are you interested in economic output (use GDP), human capabilities (try HDI), distribution (look at Gini or Palma ratios), or productive sophistication (consider Economic Complexity)? Your research question should guide your choice of indicators, never the other way around!\nCombine indicators for richer insights. The most interesting analyses come from using multiple measures together. As you’ve seen in the applications, comparing GDP with inequality measures, or economic complexity with resource endowments, reveals patterns that no single indicator could show.\nQuestion the data: Every indicator has limitations - missing informal economies, hiding regional disparities, or reflecting methodological choices. Good development economists are always curious about what the numbers don’t tell us."
