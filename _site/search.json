    "text": "How do we know if a country is “developing”? This seemingly simple question has sparked decades of debate among economists, policymakers, and development practitioners. The answer you get depends entirely on how you measure development – and as you’ll discover in this guide, there are many ways to do so.\nJust as a simple example, consider these three scenarios:\n\nCountry A has doubled its GDP per capita over the past decade, but income inequality has also increased dramatically\nCountry B has modest economic growth but has achieved universal primary education and dramatically reduced infant mortality\nCountry C exports sophisticated technology products but relies heavily on imported food and has frequent power outages\n\nWhich country is developing most successfully? The answer depends on what you think development means and how you choose to measure it. Development indicators can be both exciting and frustrating. On the one hand, they force people to be explicit about what they mean by “development.” On the other hand, however, in practice, people who use development indicators often don’t think about the big ideas and normative commitments behind these numbers. After reading this short introduction to the most common development indicators, you should be ready to do better.\n\n\nDevelopment measurement isn’t just an academic exercise. The indicators discussed below shape how real-world decisions are being made:\n\nInternational aid allocation often depends on GDP per capita and poverty headcount ratios\nInvestment flows are influenced by economic complexity and governance indicators\n\nPolicy priorities shift based on whether countries focus on economic growth, human development, or inequality reduction\nAcademic research and policy recommendations depend heavily on how we define and measure development success\n\n\n\n\nThis guide introduces you to the most important quantitative measures used in development economics today. Rather than advocating for any single approach, we’ll explore multiple perspectives – from traditional economic indicators to alternative measures that challenge conventional thinking.\nThroughout this guide, we maintain a pluralist perspective that recognizes legitimate disagreement about how to measure development. Whether you’re drawn to neoclassical growth theory, capabilities approaches, or structuralist critiques, you’ll need to understand how different schools of thought measure progress toward their vision of development.\nAs you’ll see, there is no “perfect” development indicator. Each measure captures something important while missing something else. The goal isn’t to find the one true measure, but to build your analytical toolkit so you can choose the right tools for your research questions – and understand the implications of those choices."

    "section": "2.1 Gross Domestic Product (GDP)",
    "text": "2.1 Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\nGDP is probably not only the most widely used measure for development, but also the one that received the most critiques. The main reason is that while GDP was developed as a measure for the total income in an economy, it is often used - implicitly or explicitly - as a measure for wellbeing. Something it has not been designed for in the first place. But we come back to this debate later on, here is is mainly about what GDP is in the first place. If you are looking for a slightly more complete, but still very accessible introduction, read chapter 24 of Mankiw (2024).\nDefinition & Calculation:\nA common definition of GDP is “the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period” (Mankiw 2024: 24).1 GDP aggregates many different goods and services by using their market value as a common unit - for example, it adds together cars, haircuts, and smartphones by using their prices.\nWhile this allows straightforward aggregation, it comes with drawbacks: GDP excludes most goods for which no market value is available (or uses only approximate estimations of their hypothetical market value), such as goods produced for subsistence or household consumption.\nAlso note that GDP focuses on final demand, so it does not include intermediate goods (like steel sold to car manufacturers). It also focuses on produced goods, so sales of new cars are included while sales of used cars are not.\nAn important distinction in practice is that of Real vs. Nominal GDP: Nominal GDP measures output at current market prices, while real GDP adjusts for inflation by using constant prices from a base year. For instance, if we look at the GDP for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012, nominal GDP would be calculated using the respective prices of each year. For the real GDP we need to set a base year. Assume we set 2010 as this base year. Then we compute the GDP for 2011 and 2012 using the prices from 2010 for all three years. Real GDP enables meaningful comparisons over time by removing the effect of price changes. For example, if nominal GDP doubles but all prices also double, real GDP remains unchanged - the economy has not actually grown, but only prices have.\nAnother important correction in the context of development is that of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjustment: PPP corrects for price level differences between countries, enabling better comparisons across nations. This is important because the same basket of goods might cost very different amounts of money in different countries: 1,000 USD, for instance, buys more goods in India than in Norway, simply because the price level in India is much lower than in Norway. PPP adjustments convert all countries’ GDP to a common currency (usually so called international dollars) based on what the money can actually buy domestically, rather than using market exchange rates.\nCommon Data Sources:\n\nWorld Bank World Development Indicators (WDI):\n\nNY.GDP.PCAP.CD (current US$)\nNY.GDP.PCAP.KD (constant 2015 US$)\nNY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD (PPP current international $)\n\nIMF World Economic Outlook Database: GDP per capita, current prices & PPP\nPenn World Table 10.01: rgdpe (expenditure-side real GDP), rgdpo (output-side real GDP), rgdpna (national accounts).\n\nThe expenditure-side measures GDP from spending (consumption + investment + government + net exports), while output-side measures from production value-added.\n\n\nWhat it captures and other advantages:\n\nMarket value of final goods and services, i.e. overall productive strength\nIt correlates with many more fundamental welfare measures\nStandardized methodology across countries through the UN System of National Accounts\nLong time series available (back to 1960s for most countries)\nHigh frequency updates (annual, some quarterly)\n\nWhat it omits and other disadvantages:\n\nIt has not been designed as a measure for well-being\nCorrelation with fundamental welfare measures does not imply causality\nDoes not consider the informal economy, unpaid work, subsistence production and non-market activities (significant in developing countries)\nIgnores aspects, such as income distribution, or environmental costs and resource depletion\nMarket prices may not reflect social value"

See Figure 1 and Table 1. As you can see the two are usually very similar. The larger differences for some countries point to some important structural features:\n\nFor the Philippines, GNI is much higher than GDP. This is because of the large diaspora experienced by the country, with many residences working abroad and sending remittances to their families. The resulting net primary income from abroad increases GNI above GDP.\nFor Qatar, the fact that GDP is larger than GNI points to relatively large net outflows of income to foreign residents and companies. This is due to the large share of foreign workers and foreign-owned companies in the country, resulting in substantial outflows of income as remittances and profit repatriation. As a result, net primary income from abroad is negative, making GNI lower than GDP.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Clean and reshape data\ndata_clean &lt;- data_gdp_gni |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(GDPpc) & !is.na(GNIpc)) |&gt; \n  summarise(across(\n    .cols = all_of(c(\"GDPpc\", \"GNIpc\")), \n    .fns = mean), \n    .by = \"country\") |&gt; \n  mutate(difference = GNIpc - GDPpc,\n         difference_pct = (difference/GDPpc)*100)\n\n# Visualize GDP vs GNI\nggplot(data_clean, aes(x = GDPpc, y = GNIpc, color = country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray\") +\n  geom_label_repel(aes(label=country)) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"H\") + \n  labs(title = \"GDP vs GNI per capita (PPP)\",\n       x = \"GDP per capita (PPP, current international $)\",\n       y = \"GNI per capita (PPP, current international $)\",\n       caption = \"Dashed line: GDP = GNI\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n# Show countries with largest differences\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: GNI and GDP for some selected countries.

    "text": "4.1 Gini Coefficient\nDefinition & Calculation:\nThe Gini coefficient is the most widely used measure of income (or wealth) inequality. It ranges from 0 (perfect equality, where everyone has the same income) to 1 (perfect inequality, where one person has all the income). It is often expressed as a percentage (0-100%).\nThe Gini coefficient is derived from the Lorenz curve. You get the Lorenz curve if you plot the cumulative percentage of total income received on the y axis, and the cumulative percentage of the population (ranked from poorest to richest) on the x axis. In a perfectly equal society, where each person has exactly the same income, the two percentages are always equal and the Lorenz curve is actually a straight 45 degree line. If there is at least a little inequality, the curve emerging from connecting the actual observations diverges from the straight line. This is visualized for two examples in Figure 4.

The underlying idea is that these capabilities are an important driver, not only for growth, but for development more generally.4\nA related concept is that of the product space. This is a network of products, where links between products represent the similarity in capabilities required for their production. The network shows that certain products require only a few capabilities - the products located in the periphery of the space - and other require a lot of capabilities - the products in the core. The latter are those that can only be produced by countries that have a very complex economy. This way it is a strong argument for the relevance of technological capabilities for economic development.5\nData Sources:\n\nAtlas of Economic Complexity (Harvard Growth Lab)\nObservatory of Economic Complexity (OEC)\n\nWhat it captures and other advantages:\n\nCaptures productive capabilities not measured by GDP or other traditional indicators\nStrong predictor of future economic growth and development\nIdentifies opportunities for economic diversification\nAvailable for most countries over long time series\n\nWhat it omits and other disadvantages:\n\nFocuses on exported goods\nMay not capture all forms of economic sophistication (especially in service economies)\nRequires detailed, high-quality trade data (may exclude informal trade)\nComplex methodology can be difficult to interpret for policy purposes\nPotential bias toward manufacturing over other forms of economic activity (“there are other ways to develop”)"

The relationship is non-linear. The estimated curve is the result of a quadratic regression model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8 shows that there is a negative, non-linear relationship between total income, as measured by GDP per capita, and the literacy gap. Richer countries tend to have a smaller literature gap, but the data does not tell us whether (a) countries are rich because of smaller gender inequality, or (b) gender inequality is easier to reduce in wealthy countries. The simple regression might also suffer from important variables being omitted. So you would need more sophisticated analysis tools to answer this important question about causality. Still, the observation as such is already interesting.\n\n\nIdentify interesting outliers\nhigh_income_gaps &lt;- gender_data %&gt;%\n  filter(GDPpc &gt; 14000, literacy_gap &gt; 5) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(literacy_gap)) %&gt;%\n  select(country, GDPpc, LiteracyRate_male, LiteracyRate_female, literacy_gap)\n\nlow_income_parity &lt;- gender_data %&gt;%\n  filter(GDPpc &lt; 5000, abs(literacy_gap) &lt; 2) %&gt;%\n  arrange(GDPpc) %&gt;%\n  select(country, GDPpc, LiteracyRate_male, LiteracyRate_female, literacy_gap)\n\nnegative_gaps &lt;- gender_data %&gt;%\n  filter(literacy_gap &lt; 0, abs(literacy_gap) &gt; 2) %&gt;%\n  arrange(GDPpc) %&gt;%\n  select(country, GDPpc, LiteracyRate_male, LiteracyRate_female, literacy_gap)\n\n\nInteresting is, however, not only the relationship, but also the outlier countries, that do not align well with the predicted relationship. For instance, there are some countries with very high literacy gaps despite being rather rich: Egypt and Iran are such examples. One explanation could be that both countries have acquired their wealth because of the export of particular resources, which do not require a very educated population. But again, further investigation would be necessary to reveal the true reasons.\nSimilarly, there are some countries with very low literacy gaps, despite being rather poor. The most notable example is Vanuatu, an island nation in the South Pacific made up of over 80 volcanic islands. The country has one of the region’s lowest gender literacy gaps because policies and community efforts have helped ensure that both boys and girls have nearly equal access to primary schooling, resulting in similar literacy rates for men and women despite a very traditional culture and strong gender inequalities in other areas of life.\nFinally, Lesotho is an interesting case as it has a highly negative literacy gap with women being far more literate than men. Lesotho’s negative gender literacy gap results mainly from male labor migration reducing boys’ school attendance, higher dropout rates among boys due to cultural and economic factors, as well as strong policy emphasis on female education, which has led to very high female literacy rates."

    "text": "Key Takeaways for Your Studies\nThere is no “perfect” development indicator. Each measure we’ve explored - from GDP to HDI to inequality indices - was designed for specific purposes and captures different aspects of development. This isn’t a weakness; it just means that you need different tools analytical toolkit and you need to learn how to use them together.\nThink like a researcher: Before diving into data, always ask yourself: What exactly am I trying to understand? Are you interested in economic output (use GDP), human capabilities (try HDI), distribution (look at Gini or Palma ratios), or productive sophistication (consider Economic Complexity)? Your research question should guide your choice of indicators, never the other way around!\nCombine indicators for richer insights. The most interesting analyses come from using multiple measures together. As you’ve seen in the applications, comparing GDP with inequality measures, or economic complexity with resource endowments, reveals patterns that no single indicator could show.\nQuestion the data: Every indicator has limitations - missing informal economies, hiding regional disparities, or reflecting methodological choices. Good development economists are always curious about what the numbers don’t tell us."
