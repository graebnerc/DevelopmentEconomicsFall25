  abstract = {Economic complexity methods have become popular tools in economic geography, international development and innovation studies. Here, I review economic complexity theory and applications, with a particular focus on two streams of literature: the literature on relatedness, which focuses on the evolution of specialization patterns, and the literature on metrics of economic complexity, which uses dimensionality reduction techniques to create metrics of economic sophistication that are predictive of variations in income, economic growth, emissions and income inequality. Economic complexity methods predict changes in the geography of economic activities and explain differences in economic growth, inequality, greenhouse emissions and labour market outcomes. This Review summarizes a decade of research on economic complexity and its applications. Economic complexity involves the use of machine learning and network techniques to predict and explain the economic trajectories of countries, cities and regions.Measures of relatedness --- which estimate the affinity between economies and activities --- anticipate changes in specialization patterns and explain labour market outcomes, such as income loss and unemployment.Economic complexity measures are reduced-dimensionality representations of specialization matrices that explain the geography of hundreds of economic activities.Measures of economic complexity explain and predict international and regional variations in income, economic growth, income inequality, gender inequality and greenhouse emissions.Economic complexity methods have been validated by studies at multiple geographic scales (from countries to cities) and a variety of economic activities (products, industries, occupations, patents, research papers).Relatedness metrics can be unpacked into multiple channels (such as industry, occupation and location-specific knowledge) to understand the drivers of regional diversification.

  abstract = {Abstract             This chapter argues that the World Bank's approach to estimating the extent, distribution, and trend of global income poverty is neither meaningful nor reliable. The Bank uses an arbitrary international poverty line that is not adequately anchored in any specification of the real requirements of human beings. Moreover, it employs a concept of purchasing power `equivalence' that is neither well defined nor appropriate for poverty assessment. These difficulties are inherent in the Bank's `money-metric' approach and cannot be credibly overcome without dispensing with this approach altogether. In addition, the Bank extrapolates incorrectly from limited data and thereby creates an appearance of precision that masks the high probable error of its estimates. It is difficult to judge the nature and extent of the errors in global poverty estimates that these three flaws produce. However, there is reason to believe that the Bank's approach may have led it to understate the extent of global income poverty and to infer without adequate justification that global income poverty has steeply declined in the recent period. A new methodology of global poverty assessment, focused directly on what is needed to achieve elementary human requirements, is feasible and necessary. A practical approach to implementing an alternative is described.},

Even as they became fabulously wealthy, the rich have seen their taxes collapse to levels last seen in the 1920s. Meanwhile, working-class Americans have been asked to pay more. The Triumph of Injustice is a forensic investigation into this dramatic transformation. Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, economists who revolutionized the study of inequality, demonstrate how the super-rich pay a lower tax rate than everybody else. In crystalline prose, they dissect the deliberate choices and the sins of indecision that have fueled this trend: the gradual exemption of capital owners; the surge of a new tax-avoidance industry; and, most critically, tax competition between nations. It is not too late to change course. Instead of competition, we could choose cooperation, finding ways to create a tax regime that serves universal, democratic ends. The Triumph of Injustice offers a visionary and practical reinvention of taxes for that globalized world"},

The pace and scope of economic development continues its rapid, uneven, and sometimes unexpected evolution. This text explains the unprecedented progress that has been made in many parts of the developing world but fully confronts the enormous problems and challenges that remain to be addressed in the years ahead. The text shows the wide diversity across the developing world and the differing positions in the global economy that are held by developing countries. The principles of development economics are key to understanding how we got to where we are, how great progress has been made in recent years, and why many development problems remain so difficult to solve. The principles of development economics are also key to the design of successful economic development policy and programs as we look ahead. The field of economic development is versatile and has much to contribute regarding these differing scenarios. Thus, the text also underlines common features that are exhibited by a majority of developing nations, using the insights of the study of economic development. The few countries that have essentially completed the transformation to become developed economies, such as South Korea, are also examined as potential models for other developing countries to follow. Both theory and empirical analysis in development economics have made major strides, and the Twelfth Edition brings these ideas and findings to students. Legitimate controversies are actively debated in development economics, and so the text presents contending theories and interpretations of evidence, with three goals. The first goal is to ensure that students understand real conditions and institutions across the developing world. The second is to help students develop analytic skills while broadening their perspectives of the wide scope of the field. The third is to provide students with the resources to draw independent conclusions as they confront development problems, their sometimes ambiguous evidence, and real-life development policy choices-ultimately, to play an informed role in the struggle for economic development and ending extreme poverty"--},

  abstract = {We are well aware of the rise of the 1\% as the rapid growth of economic inequality has put the majority of the world's wealth in the pockets of fewer and fewer. One much-discussed solution to this imbalance is to significantly increase the rate at which we tax the wealthy. But with an enormous amount of the world's wealth hidden in tax havens--in countries like Switzerland, Luxembourg, and the Cayman Islands--this wealth cannot be fully accounted for and taxed fairly. No one, from economists to bankers to politicians, has been able to quantify exactly how much of the world's assets are currently hidden--until now. Gabriel Zucman is the first economist to offer reliable insight into the actual extent of the world's money held in tax havens. And it's staggering. In The Hidden Wealth of Nations, Zucman offers an inventive and sophisticated approach to quantifying how big the problem is, how tax havens work and are organized, and how we can begin to approach a solution. His reasearch reveals that tax havens are a quickly growing danger to the world economy. In the past five years, the amount of wealth in tax havens has increased over 25\%--there has never been as much money held offshore as there is today. This hidden wealth accounts for at least \$7.6 trillion, equivalent to 8\% of the global financial assets of households. Fighting the notion that any attempts to vanquish tax havens are futile, since some countries will always offer more advantageous tax rates than others, as well as the counterargument that since the financial crisis tax havens have disappeared, Zucman shows how both sides are actually very wrong. In [this book], he offers an ambitious agenda for reform, focused on ways in which countries can change the incentives of tax havens. Only by first understanding the enormity of the secret wealth can we begin to estimate the kind of actions that would force tax havens to give up their practices. Zucman's work has quickly become the gold standard for quantifying the amount of the world's assets held in havens. In this concise book, he lays out in approachable language how the international banking system works and the dangerous extent to which the large-scale evasion of taxes is undermining the global market as a whole. -- Inside jacket flaps},
